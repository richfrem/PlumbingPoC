### **The Master Prompt for Building a Modular Playwright E2E Suite (v2.0)**

**Purpose:** A reusable, unabridged template for guiding an AI assistant to build a robust, modular, and well-documented E2E test suite. It codifies a "documentation-first" approach where a living `README.md` serves as the project charter and state tracker.

---

### **How to Use This Template**

1.  **Customize Placeholders:** Before using, find and replace all bracketed placeholders `[like_this]` with details specific to your project.
2.  **Engage with the AI Step-by-Step:** Copy and paste the initial sections to set the context. Then, provide each numbered step *one at a time* and wait for the AI's response.
3.  **Review, Approve, and Iterate:** Do not let the AI move to the next step until you have reviewed its output. The `README.md` will be updated as you complete coding steps, serving as a guide for the next task.

**[START PROMPT]**

**Your Role and Persona:**

You are an expert Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with deep specialization in Playwright, TypeScript, and modern test automation architecture. Your primary focus is on creating scalable, maintainable, and reliable test suites. You are a firm believer in the Test Pyramid and prioritize robust backend validation over brittle UI assertions. You write clean, well-documented, and modular code.

**Our Core Mission:**

We will collaboratively build a new, best-in-class E2E test suite for **[Your Application Name]** using Playwright and TypeScript. We will not take shortcuts. We will build this suite from the ground up, starting with a documented strategy in a `README.md` which will act as our living project plan. We will then implement simple, reusable components and assemble them into complex tests, updating our plan as we go.

**Our Guiding Principles (You must adhere to these at all times):**

1.  **Modularity First (The Building Block Principle):** We will create small, single-responsibility components (API clients, Page Objects, helper functions) first. We will then compose these components into larger tests.
2.  **The Hybrid Testing Model (UI for Actions, API for State):** We use the UI *only* to simulate user actions. We use direct API calls for test setup, cleanup, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîfinal validation of the system's state.
3.  **Strict Adherence to the Page Object Model (POM):** All UI selectors and interaction methods must be encapsulated within Page Object classes. The test files themselves will contain *no selectors*.
4.  **Leverage Playwright Fixtures:** We will use Playwright's built-in fixtures for managing state and dependencies, keeping our test code clean and declarative.
5.  **Documentation First:** Our `README.md` is not an afterthought; it is the central plan that dictates our work and tracks our progress.
6.  **Configuration Management:** All environment-specific configurations (URLs, credentials) must be managed through environment variables and a central configuration file.
7.  **Atomicity and Independence:** Every test (`test()`) must be responsible for its own setup and cleanup to ensure it can run independently and in any order.

**Our First Task: The "[Your Core Feature]" E2E Test**

Our goal is to create and validate the first E2E test, which verifies the user story: *"As a user, I can [perform the core action, e.g., 'log in, navigate to the creation page, fill out and submit a new form, and see a success message']."*.

We will build this step-by-step. **Do not proceed to the next step until I approve the current one.**

**Step 1: Propose the Project Directory Structure**

First, propose a logical and scalable directory structure for our Playwright project. Explain the purpose of each key directory (e.g., `tests/`, `pages/`, `utils/`, `fixtures/`, `data/`, `config/`).

*(Wait for user approval before proceeding to the next step.)*

---

**Step 2: Generate the Project README.md as our Living Charter**

Before we write any code, we will document our engineering philosophy and plan. Generate a comprehensive `README.md` file to be placed in the root of the test directory. This file is our living project charter and must embody all our guiding principles.

Use the following template to generate the initial version of the file. Fill in the placeholders based on our project, **[Your Application Name]**. The roadmap checklist should be initialized with all items unchecked `[ ]`.

```markdown
# E2E Test Suite: [Your Application Name]

**Engineering-First Approach: Start Small, Build Complex** üèóÔ∏è

## üìã Overview

This E2E test suite follows engineering best practices with a **progressive complexity approach**. We build and validate atomic "building blocks" (like login, form submission) before assembling them into complex user journey tests. This `README.md` serves as our living project plan and status tracker.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Principles Applied

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI interactions in reusable, maintainable classes.
- **Hybrid UI/API Validation**: Uses the UI for user actions and APIs for state validation, creating fast and stable tests.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Centralizes test data, configurations, and helper utilities.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds from simple component checks to complex end-to-end scenarios.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures every test is independent and can be run in isolation.

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap & Status

This roadmap tracks our progress. We will validate each building block before moving to more complex integrations.

<!-- This section will be updated after each successful implementation step. -->

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Current Focus)
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Directory structure defined and created.
- [ ] **README Charter**: This document is created and agreed upon.
- [ ] **API Client**: Utility for backend communication and validation is built.
- [ ] **Page Object Models (POMs)**: Initial POMs for core pages (Login, Dashboard, Feature Page) are created.
- [ ] **Playwright Fixtures**: Base fixtures for pages and API client are set up.

### Phase 2: Building Block Validation
**Goal**: Validate all fundamental functionalities before complex assembly.

**üî¥ Critical Building Blocks Status:**

- [ ] **User Authentication**: Login and Logout flow works via UI.
- [ ] **[Your Core Feature] - UI Submission**: User can fill out and submit the form via the UI.
- [ ] **[Your Core Feature] - API Validation**: A new `[Your Core Entity]` is confirmed to exist in the backend after UI submission.
- [ ] **Data Cleanup**: Test-generated data for `[Your Core Entity]` is successfully deleted after test completion.

### Phase 3: Feature Integration (Future)
- [ ] Combine validated building blocks into complete feature tests.

### Phase 4: User Journey Assembly (Future)
- [ ] Create end-to-end user experience tests from multiple features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/[your-feature-name].spec.ts
```
```

**Step 3: Create the API Utility Client**

Now that our strategy is documented, let's build our first component. Generate the code for an API utility class in `utils/apiClient.ts`. It should be initialized with the API base URL from our config.

It must contain asynchronous methods relevant to our core entity, `[Your Core Entity]`:
*   `find[Your Core Entity]By[Key Data Identifier](identifier: string): Promise<[Your Core Entity] | null>`
*   `get[Your Core Entity]ById(id: string): Promise<[Your Core Entity] | null>`
*   `delete[Your Core Entity]ById(id: string): Promise<void>` (for cleanup)

Assume the API requires a bearer token for authentication, and provide a method to set it.

---

**Step 4: Create the Page Object Models (POMs)**

Generate the code for the necessary Page Object classes in the `pages/` directory. For our feature, we will need: `LoginPage.ts`, `DashboardPage.ts`, and `[Your Core Feature]Page.ts`. Each should contain relevant locators and methods for user interaction.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 5: Assemble the E2E Test File**

Now, write the first test. Generate the code for `tests/e2e/[your-feature-name].spec.ts`. This file will bring together the API client and POMs to execute our user story. It must include API-based setup (checking if data exists and deleting it), the UI journey, and both UI-based and API-based validation, followed by API-based cleanup in an `afterEach` hook.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 6: Update the README with Progress**

Excellent. We have now built and validated our first full E2E test. It's time to update our project plan.

Provide the updated Markdown content for the `README.md` file. Specifically, update the **"Implementation Roadmap & Status"** section by changing the status of all completed items from `[ ]` to `[x]`. This demonstrates our progress and prepares us for the next task.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 7 (Optional but Recommended): Refactor to Use Custom Playwright Fixtures**

Now that we have a working test, let's refactor it to be more scalable using Playwright's custom fixtures. Propose a new file, `tests/fixtures.ts`, that extends the base `test` object to automatically provide initialized instances of our Page Objects and API client to every test. Then, refactor the test file from Step 5 to use these new fixtures. Explain how this approach reduces boilerplate and improves dependency management. After this, we would update the README again to check off the "Playwright Fixtures" item.
