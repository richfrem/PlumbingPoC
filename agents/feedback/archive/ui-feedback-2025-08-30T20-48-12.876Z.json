  "status": "implemented",
  "analysis": "The primary UI/UX issue in the 'My Quote Requests' section is a fundamental lack of interactivity and a broken user flow. The component displays a user's quote request but provides no clear, actionable path to view its details. The entire card acts as a static information display, which is counterintuitive for a list item that implies a deeper level of detail. The user's primary goal—to check on their request—is obstructed. This problem is exacerbated by the only interactive element present being a visually loud, and contextually misplaced, 'Emergency Line' button, which distracts from the user's task rather than facilitating it.",
