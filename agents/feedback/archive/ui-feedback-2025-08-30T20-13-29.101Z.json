  "analysis": "The \"My Quote Requests\" section presents a significant UI layout flaw that compromises visual hierarchy and user focus. The quote request card and the \"Emergency Line\" button are placed within a flex container using `justify-between`, pushing them to opposite ends of the content area. This creates a visually jarring, unbalanced composition with excessive negative space. The high-contrast red \"Emergency Line\" button visually competes with the user's primary information (the quote request card), creating confusion about the relationship between the two elements and disrupting the logical flow. This layout fails the design principle of proximity (grouping related items) and is not scalable for multiple quote requests.",
