  "status": "implemented",
  "analysis": "The user interface is clean, modern, and professional. However, a few high-impact refinements can significantly improve visual hierarchy, scannability, and user clarity. The primary navigation has competing calls-to-action, with the secondary 'Dashboard' button having the same visual weight as the primary 'Call Now' button. In the services section, the icons are somewhat small and light in color, reducing their impact and the section's scannability. Finally, the button copy in the 'Request a Quote' modal is abrupt ('YES'/'NO') and could be more descriptive to improve user confidence, especially in a stressful emergency situation.",
