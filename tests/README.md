# E2E Test Suite: PlumbingPOC

**Engineering-First Approach: Start Small, Build Complex** 🏗️

## 📋 Overview

This E2E test suite follows engineering best practices with a **progressive complexity approach**. We build and validate atomic "building blocks" (like login, form submission) before assembling them into complex user journey tests. This `README.md` serves as our living project plan and status tracker.

## 🏗️ Key Principles Applied

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI interactions in reusable, maintainable classes.
- **Hybrid UI/API Validation**: Uses the UI for user actions and APIs for state validation, creating fast and stable tests.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Centralizes test data, configurations, and helper utilities.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds from simple component checks to complex end-to-end scenarios.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures every test is independent and can be run in isolation.

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap & Status

This roadmap tracks our progress. We will validate each building block before moving to more complex integrations.

<!-- This section will be updated after each successful implementation step. -->

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Current Focus)
- [x] **Project Structure**: Directory structure defined and created.
- [x] **README Charter**: This document is created and agreed upon.
- [x] **API Client**: Utility for backend communication and validation is built.
- [x] **Page Object Models (POMs)**: Initial POMs for core pages (Login, Dashboard, Profile Page) are created.
- [x] **Playwright Fixtures**: Base fixtures for pages and API client are set up.

### Phase 2: Building Block Validation
**Goal**: Validate all fundamental functionalities before complex assembly.

**✅ Critical Building Blocks Status:**

- [x] **User Authentication**: Login and Logout flow works via UI.
- [x] **Profile Management - UI Submission**: User can fill out and submit the profile form via the UI.
- [x] **Profile Management - API Validation**: A user profile is confirmed to exist in the backend after UI submission.
- [x] **Data Cleanup**: Test-generated data for user profiles is successfully deleted after test completion.

### Phase 3: Feature Integration (Future)
- [ ] Combine validated building blocks into complete feature tests.

### Phase 4: User Journey Assembly (Future)
- [ ] Create end-to-end user experience tests from multiple features.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/profile/profile-management.spec.ts
```

- [End-to-End (E2E) Test Strategy](./e2e/README.md)
- [Unit Test Strategy](./unit/README.md)

## 🛠️ How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run only API integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run only E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
