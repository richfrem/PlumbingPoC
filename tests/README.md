# 🏗️ **Testing Strategy: Google Testing Pyramid**

**Complete Test Coverage Across All Layers** 🧪

## 📋 Overview

This comprehensive testing strategy follows **Google's Testing Pyramid** with balanced coverage across all testing layers. We maintain **proportional test distribution** where lower-level tests (unit) are numerous and fast, while higher-level tests (E2E) are fewer but comprehensive.

This `README.md` serves as our master testing strategy document and coverage tracker.

## 🏗️ Key Principles Applied

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI interactions in reusable, maintainable classes.
- **Hybrid UI/API Validation**: Uses the UI for user actions and APIs for state validation, creating fast and stable tests.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Centralizes test data, configurations, and helper utilities.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds from simple component checks to complex end-to-end scenarios.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures every test is independent and can be run in isolation.

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap & Status

This roadmap tracks our progress. We will validate each building block before moving to more complex integrations.

<!-- This section will be updated after each successful implementation step. -->

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Current Focus)
- [x] **Project Structure**: Directory structure defined and created.
- [x] **README Charter**: This document is created and agreed upon.
- [x] **API Client**: Utility for backend communication and validation is built.
- [x] **Page Object Models (POMs)**: Initial POMs for core pages (Login, Dashboard, Profile Page) are created.
- [x] **Playwright Fixtures**: Base fixtures for pages and API client are set up.

### Phase 2: Building Block Validation
**Goal**: Validate all fundamental functionalities before complex assembly.

**✅ Critical Building Blocks Status:**

- [x] **User Authentication**: Login and Logout flow works via UI.
- [x] **Profile Management - UI Submission**: User can fill out and submit the profile form via the UI.
- [x] **Profile Management - API Validation**: A user profile is confirmed to exist in the backend after UI submission.
- [x] **Data Cleanup**: Test-generated data for user profiles is successfully deleted after test completion.
- [x] **Test Data Management**: Automated cleanup API for E2E test data with safety controls.

### Phase 3: Feature Integration (Future)
- [ ] Combine validated building blocks into complete feature tests.

### Phase 4: AI Component Testing (New)
- [ ] **Strategy Defined**: ADR-009 created for AI component testing approach.
- [ ] **Mock Implementation**: OpenAI API calls mocked for deterministic testing.
- [ ] **Contract Validation**: Test AI response parsing and error handling.
- [ ] **Integration Complete**: AI tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline.

### Phase 5: User Journey Assembly (Future)
- [ ] Create end-to-end user experience tests from multiple features.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run a specific test file (updated paths)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/auth/authentication.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/user-journeys/core-functionality.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/specs/admin-journeys/admin-dashboard.spec.ts
```

### Test Data Cleanup
E2E tests create real database records for validation. Use the cleanup API to remove test data:

```bash
# Dry run - see what would be deleted (safe)
curl -X DELETE "https://your-api.com/api/requests/cleanup-test-data" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Actually delete test data (dangerous - use carefully)
curl -X DELETE "https://your-api.com/api/requests/cleanup-test-data" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dryRun": false, "confirmDelete": true}'
```

**Safety Features:**
- Admin authentication required
- Dry-run mode by default
- Only deletes specific test patterns (not everything)
- Requires explicit confirmation for deletion
- Audit logging of all operations
- Disabled in production without test header
```
