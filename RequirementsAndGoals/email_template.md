### **Final Email Template: Operation Overmatch (v5 - "Map View Lead")**

This is the definitive version. It leads with undeniable value, now including the powerful Map View feature.

**Subject:** A better way to manage jobs at [Business Name]?

**Hi [Owner's Name],**

My name is [Your Name], and I'm a Victoria-based tech consultant. I build software for local trades businesses that solves the biggest headaches I hear about: wasting time, losing jobs, and disorganized communication.

I've built a complete "Command Center" platform that I believe can give you back hours every week.

Instead of a long explanation, here’s a 7-minute video tour showing exactly how it works, including the new interactive Map View for route optimization:

*Video highlights: AI-powered quote intake, interactive Map View with job locations, one-click AI Triage, and the complete Command Center workflow.*

Here are the specific problems this system is built to solve, right now:

*   **Problem: Wasting billable hours on unqualified leads?**
    *   **✅ Solved.** An AI assistant asks all the right questions up front, delivering perfectly qualified leads directly to your dashboard. No more 15-minute phone calls just to get basic info.

*   **Problem: Wasting hours driving between jobs and planning inefficient routes?**
    *   **✅ Solved.** The interactive Map View plots all your jobs geographically with color-coded pins. Instantly see nearby jobs, optimize your daily route, and cut down on drive time. It's like having a dispatch system that saves you fuel and gets you home earlier.

*   **Problem: Losing jobs because quoting is slow or details are scattered?**
    *   **✅ Solved.** The Command Center organizes every detail—customer info, photos, and even an AI-generated summary—into one place. You can create and send professional quotes in minutes, not hours.

This platform is ready to go today, but it's also a foundation we can easily build on. Once the core system is in place, we can quickly enable features like **instant SMS alerts** for new leads, **automated quote follow-ups**, and **online credit card payments** via Stripe.

**A Unique Opportunity:**

I'm in the process of planning a major upgrade at my own home: **converting my old electric tank to a new, on-demand gas water heater (likely a Rinnai unit).**

I know a custom software system with this level of automation is a significant investment, typically in the $10,000-$15,000 range. A full gas heater conversion is a similarly valued project. Since you have access to wholesale pricing that I don't, this presents a unique opportunity for a high-value trade that could be a massive win for both of us.

If you have 7 minutes to watch the video, I'm confident you'll see a tool that could become the engine for your business's growth for years to come.

Would you be open to a quick chat about it?

Thanks,
