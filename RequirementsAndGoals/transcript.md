**(Shot 1: Customer Experience - Start on your landing page)**
"Hi, I wanted to show you a quick look at an AI-powered system I've built to help local trades businesses save time and win more jobs."
"This is the professional homepage your customers would see. Let's walk through how a new customer requests a quote."
**[ACTION]: Click "Request a Quote".**
"First, the customer can sign in instantly and securely using their own Google or Microsoft accounts, or a standard email and password. There's no new account for them to manage."
**[ACTION]: Click "Continue with Google" and quickly complete the login.**
"Once they're in, they start a conversation with your AI assistant. The assistant's first job is to understand exactly what they need."
**[ACTION]: Select a service category, like "Perimeter Drains".**
"The AI starts with the standard questions for that service. But here's where it gets smart."
**[ACTION]: Answer the initial questions quickly.**
*(Pause for a moment as the "Thinking..." message appears)*
"Right now, the AI is analyzing the customer's answers. It understands the context and generates intelligent, follow-up questions to get all the details you'd normally have to ask over the phone."
**[ACTION]: Show the new AI-generated questions appearing. Answer them.**
"The customer can also upload photos of the problem area directly from their phone or computer, which gives you eyes on the job before you even send a quote."
**[ACTION]: Upload a dummy photo file.**
"Finally, the system gives them a clean summary to review. Once they confirm, the job is done for them, and you get a perfect lead."
**[ACTION]: Click "Confirm & Submit Request". Show the "Thank you" screen.**
"Right at this moment, you're getting an instant SMS alert on your phone about this new lead, so you can respond immediately while it's still hot."

**(Shot 2: Owner's Experience - Switch to your Admin Browser Window)**
"Now, let's look at what you see as the business owner. This is your command center."
**[ACTION]: Refresh the Admin Dashboard. The new request should appear at the top of the Table View.**
"The new request from our customer appears instantly at the top of your job list. You can see all your jobs here, but the real power comes from visualizing them."
**[ACTION]: Click the "Map" toggle at the top of the dashboard to switch to Map View.**
"With one click, your entire workload is plotted on a map with a clean, professional interface. **No more manually typing addresses into Google Maps at the end of the day.**"
**[ACTION]: Zoom in and out on the map to show how the pins cluster together.**
"You can instantly see which jobs are in the same neighborhood so you can plan the most efficient route. **This is how you turn wasted drive time back into billable hours.**"
**[ACTION]: Point out the color-coded pins - blue for new, yellow for viewed, orange for quoted, green for accepted, etc.**
"Each pin color tells you the exact status at a glance - no need to click to see if it's been quoted or scheduled."
**[ACTION]: Demonstrate the advanced filtering controls at the top.**
"Want to focus on today's work? Use the Schedule filter to show only jobs scheduled for today. Need to see emergencies only? Toggle the emergency filter. The system gives you surgical precision over your workload."
**[ACTION]: Click on one of the new pins to open the info window.**
"And from the map, you can get a quick look at the job details and jump right into the full docket."
**[ACTION]: Click the "View Full Job Docket" button from inside the map's info window. This should open the modal directly.**
"But first, let me show you the improved table view that makes triage even faster."
**[ACTION]: Switch back to Table view to demonstrate the optimized layout.**
"The table is now organized by priority - status first, then AI priority score, then urgency flags. You can see at a glance which jobs need attention and which are emergencies."
**[ACTION]: Point out the color-coded status chips and the clean null value handling.**
"Now let's see the complete workflow in action. Inside the docket, everything is perfectly organized. But before you even read the details, you have an AI partner."
**[ACTION]: Click the "AI Triage" button. Let the results appear.**
"With one click, your AI assistant analyzes the entire request and gives you a triage summary and a priority score, so you know instantly if this is a high-value job that needs your attention now."
**[ACTION]: Scroll down through the Job Docket modal, showing the organized sections: customer answers, photos, etc.**
"You've got everything you need right here—no more juggling texts, emails, or notepads. From here, you can add your official quote..."
**[ACTION]: Quickly create a simple quote. Change the status from "New" to "Quoted".**
"...and with that, a professional quote is sent, and the customer is notified. The whole process, from new lead to quote sent, takes about 90 seconds."
**[ACTION]: Demonstrate the complete workflow by showing how the status automatically updates when the customer views the quote.**
"When the customer opens their portal to review the quote, the system automatically changes the status from 'Quoted' to 'Viewed' - no manual intervention needed. This gives you perfect visibility into customer engagement."
**[ACTION]: Briefly switch back to the Customer View and refresh the "My Requests" page to show the new "Quoted" status appearing instantly.**
"And the customer sees that update in their portal in real-time, which gives them the confidence that you're on top of it."
"When the customer accepts your quote, you'll get another SMS alert instantly, so you can start scheduling the job right away. The system tracks the complete lifecycle: New → Quoted → Viewed → Accepted → Scheduled → Completed."
