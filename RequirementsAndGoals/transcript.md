**(Shot 1: Customer Experience - Start on your landing page)**
"Hi, I wanted to show you a quick look at an AI-powered system I've built to help local trades businesses save time and win more jobs."
"This is the professional homepage your customers would see. Let's walk through how a new customer requests a quote."
**[ACTION]: Click "Request a Quote".  This will ask a user to login so the quote request is associated with a person you can contact**
"First, the customer can sign in instantly and securely using their own Google or Microsoft accounts, or a standard email and password. There's no new account for them to manage."
**[ACTION]: Click "Continue with Google" and quickly complete the login.**
"Once they're in, they start a conversation with your AI assistant. The assistant's first job is to understand exactly what they need."
**[ACTION]: Select a service category, like "Perimeter Drains".**
"The AI starts with the standard questions for that service. But here's where it gets smart."
**[ACTION]: Answer the initial questions quickly.**
*(Pause for a moment as the "Thinking..." message appears)*
"Right now, the AI is analyzing the customer's answers. It understands the context and generates intelligent, follow-up questions to get all the details you'd normally have to ask over the phone."
**[ACTION]: Show the new AI-generated questions appearing. Answer them.**
"The customer can also upload photos of the problem area directly from their phone or computer, which gives you eyes on the job before you even send a quote."
**[ACTION]: Upload your dummy `leak.jpg` file.**
"Finally, the system gives them a clean summary to review. Once they confirm, the job is done for them, and you get a perfect lead."
**[ACTION]: Click "Confirm & Submit Request". Show the "Thank you" screen.**

**(Shot 2: Owner's Experience - Switch to your Admin Browser Window)**
"Now, let's look at what you see as the business owner. This is your command center."
**[ACTION]: Refresh the Admin Dashboard. The new request should appear at the top.**
"The new request from our customer appears instantly. But instead of just raw data, you have an AI partner."
**[ACTION]: Click the "AI Triage" button for the new request. Let the results appear.**
"With one click, your AI assistant analyzes the entire request and gives you a triage summary, a priority score, and even a profitability score, so you know exactly which jobs to focus on first."
**[ACTION]: Click on the request to open the Job Docket modal.**
"Inside the docket, you have everything you need, perfectly organized: all the customer's answers, the photos they sent, and a full communication log."
**[ACTION]: Scroll down, showing the different sections.**
"From here, you can add your official quote and update the job status with a single click."
**[ACTION]: Quickly create a simple quote. Change the status from "New" to "Quoted".**
"The best part is, this is a full client portal. The customer can log back in anytime to see the status of their request and review the quote you just sent."
**[ACTION]: Briefly switch back to the Customer View and refresh the "My Requests" page to show the new "Quoted" status and quote amount.**

**(Final Shot: Back on Admin View, ready to close)**
**YOU:**
"So, in under two minutes, the system handled a new lead, qualified them with AI, triaged the job for you, and organized everything into a simple command center, all without a single phone call."
"This is the kind of tool that saves hours every week and puts you ahead of the competition."
