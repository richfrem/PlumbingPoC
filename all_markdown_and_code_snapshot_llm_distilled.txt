# Priority Action Plan: PlumbingPOC Refactoring

This plan outlines the highest-impact tasks to transition the PlumbingPOC application from a mature prototype to a robust, production-ready system.

1.  **Establish a Testing Foundation:**
    *   **Action:** Introduce `vitest` to the project for unit and integration testing.
    *   **Task:** Write initial unit tests for critical utility functions (e.g., `getRequestStatusChipColor`).
    *   **Task:** Write initial integration tests for the most critical, unauthenticated API endpoints to establish the testing pattern.
    *   **Justification:** This is the highest priority. No further refactoring should proceed without a safety net to prevent regressions.

2.  **Harden the AI Follow-Up Question Agent:**
    *   **Action:** Refactor the `getGptFollowUp` controller in `vite-app/api/controllers/requestController.js`.
    *   **Task:** Update the OpenAI prompt to request a structured JSON output (`{ "requiresFollowUp": boolean, "questions": [...] }`).
    *   **Task:** Use `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` in the API call and replace the brittle string-splitting logic with `JSON.parse`.
    *   **Justification:** This fixes the most fragile component in the system and eliminates a likely source of production errors.

3.  **Implement Observability for AI Components:**
    *   **Action:** Add structured logging to the backend controllers that interact with OpenAI.
    *   **Task:** In `triageController.js` and `requestController.js`, log the "Golden Signals": latency (call duration) and cost (token usage from the API response).
    *   **Task:** Wrap `JSON.parse()` in a `try...catch` block and log any parsing failures as critical errors.
    *   **Justification:** Provides essential visibility into the cost and performance of the most expensive parts of the application.

4.  **Integrate Testing into the CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **Action:** Update the `netlify.toml` configuration file.
    *   **Task:** Modify the `build` command to `npm run test:ci && tsc --noEmit && npm run build`.
    *   **Task:** Add the `test:ci` script to `package.json` (e.g., `"test:ci": "vitest run"`).
    *   **Justification:** Automates quality control and ensures that no code that fails tests or type-checks can be deployed.

5.  **Formalize All Documentation:**
    *   **Action:** Populate the `adrs/` and `docs/` directories with the generated artifacts from the architectural review.
    *   **Task:** Create the new ADR files (`006`, `007`, `008`).
    *   **Task:** Overwrite `docs/DataContracts.md` with the new, comprehensive version.
    *   **Justification:** Ensures all team members (current and future) have a shared understanding of the system's architecture and data flows, reducing onboarding time and preventing architectural drift.

# The Quantum Diamond AI Application Development Framework
**Version:** 3.0

## Overview
Traditional development models are breaking under the creative and technical pressures of the AI age. Teams are caught in a false dichotomy: move fast with inspired "vibe coding" and risk building brittle, unmaintainable systems, or move slowly with rigorous "architecture-first" discipline and risk engineering the wrong solution perfectly.

**The Quantum Diamond Framework is the synthesis that resolves this conflict.**

It is a next-generation workflow designed for a world of collaborative AI. It honors the lineage of the best human-centric and engineering practices, fusing them into a single, coherent whole:

It takes the empathetic, problem-finding power of **Service Design** and **Triple Diamond Design**.

It supercharges discovery and validation with AI-powered **"Vibe Coding"**—not as a reckless shortcut, but as a sanctioned, high-speed prototyping tool.

It channels the resulting validated vision into the unyielding discipline of 

**Architecture-First Development** and the rigorous safety net of **Test-Driven Design**.
The result is a framework that allows teams to be both radically creative and impeccably engineered. It provides a shared language for designers, architects, and product leaders to navigate the quantum possibilities of AI, collapsing them into classical, reliable, and valuable software.

This repository contains the complete methodology for building the next generation of AI-native applications.

**Human Lead (Architecture/Eng):** [Name]

## Core Principles: Human Intent, AI Velocity, Engineering Rigor

This workflow fuses human strategic insight with the generative power of AI agents, all grounded in the discipline of production-grade engineering.

1.  **Human-Led Vision:** The human is the strategist, the empath, the curator, and the final decision-maker.
2.  **AI-Powered Velocity:** We treat AI not as a tool, but as a team of tireless, expert agents to accelerate discovery and prototyping.
3.  **Disciplined Engineering:** Creativity is channeled into structure. A validated vision is translated into a reliable, secure, and maintainable system.

## The Two Cycles of the Quantum Diamond Framework

The workflow consists of two distinct cycles. The first is a fluid, creative loop for envisioning the right solution. The second is a structured, predictable path to build that solution right.

## Phase I: 🌀 The Genesis Cycle (Envision the Right Thing)

**Goal:** To explore a quantum wave of possibilities and collapse it into a single, validated vision. This phase is a dynamic, creative conversation between a human lead and their AI agents, prioritizing exploration and learning over structure.

The specific techniques, prompts, and agent interactions for this phase are detailed in its dedicated playbook.

mew➡️ **For a detailed guide, see the [Playbook: The Genesis Cycle](./01_playbook-genesis-cycle.md).**

---
## Phase II: ⚙️ The Engineering Cycle (Build the Thing Right)

**Goal:** To take the validated vision—the collapsed reality—and build it right. This phase is about disciplined, deterministic execution where architectural rigor, types, tests, and schemas are paramount.

This is the direct implementation of the architecture-first development process.

➡️ **For a detailed, step-by-step guide, see the [Playbook: The Engineering Cycle](./02_Playbook_EngineeringCycle.md).**

---
## Repository Structure

The **Quantum Diamond Framework** is defined across the following documents:

*   **`README.md`**: (This file) The high-level overview of the entire process.
*   **`01_Playbook_GenesisCycle.md`**: A tactical guide for product managers and designers on running the creative, human-AI collaborative cycle.

# Playbook: The Genesis Cycle
**Version:** 2.0
**Part of:** The Quantum Diamond Framework

This playbook is a guide for the first phase of the **Quantum Diamond Framework**. Its goal is to rapidly explore, define, and validate a product vision through creative human-AI collaboration.

## The Actors

*   **Human Lead (Designer/PM):** The director of the process. You provide the intent, curate the AI's output, and make the final strategic decisions.
*   **AI Service Designer Agent:** Your research and strategy partner. You use this agent (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to synthesize information and explore the problem space.
*   **AI App Prototyper Agent:** Your implementation partner. You use this agent (e.g., `bolt.new`, Copilot in a scratchpad) to make ideas tangible instantly.

## The Process: A Conversation

### Step 1: Problem Framing with the AI Service Designer

Your goal is to deeply understand the user and the problem.

**Example Prompt Flow:**

1.  **Human Input:** "I've just interviewed 5 users about our support process. Here are the full transcripts: [paste transcripts]. Please act as an expert service designer. Your first task is to summarize the key pain points and pull out 3-5 powerful quotes for each user."
2.  **Human Curation:** Review the summary and provide feedback for refinement.
3.  **Human Prompt for Generation:** "Based on these refined pain points, generate three distinct user personas. Include their goals, frustrations, and a key 'How Might We' statement for each."

### Step 2: Solution Prototyping with the AI App Prototyper

Your goal is to make a potential solution visible and interactive. This is **purposeful vibe coding.** The code is disposable; the learning is permanent.

**Example Prompt Flow:**

1.  **Human Input (UI):** "Create a new web page with a title 'Support Ticket Analyzer'. It should have a large text area for pasting an email and a button that says 'Analyze'."
2.  **Human Input (Logic):** "I need a Python function using `instructor` and `pydantic`. The input is a string of text. The output should be a Pydantic model called `TicketAnalysis` containing: `summary`, `is_urgent`, and `suggested_category`. Write the function and a sample call."
3.  **Human Synthesis:** Hook the UI and logic together in a tool like Replit to create a clickable prototype.

### Step 3: Validation and Iteration

You now have a tangible artifact. Show it to stakeholders and users. This is the "observation" that collapses the wave of possibilities into a single reality.

*   "The summary is great, but the category is always wrong." -> Go back to Step 2 and refine the logic prompt.
*   "This is useful, but what I *really* need is..." -> Go back to Step 1 to re-evaluate the core problem.

## Definition of Done

The Genesis Cycle is complete when you have produced the artifacts needed to kick off the Engineering Cycle:
*   ✅ A **Validated Vision Prototype** that has received positive feedback from key stakeholders.
*   ✅ An **Initial AI Component Contract** (a simple doc outlining the prototype's inputs/outputs).

# Playbook: The Engineering Cycle
**Version:** 3.0
**Part of:** The Quantum Diamond Framework

## The Core Principle: Engineer the Reality

The Genesis Cycle explores the quantum realm of possibilities. It's creative, chaotic, and divergent. This Engineering Cycle is where we collapse that possibility into a single, classical, deterministic reality. **The fundamental goal of this playbook is to eliminate improvisation from the production path.** We are not exploring; we are building. This is the factory blueprint.

## The Handoff

The input to this cycle is the **Validated Vision Prototype** and **Initial AI Component Contract** from the Genesis Cycle.

---
### Stage 0: Strategy & System Design (The Blueprint)
1.  **Formalize the AI Component Contract:** Convert the initial contract into a version-controlled Pydantic/Zod schema and a detailed markdown document with inputs, outputs, and all constraints (Performance, Cost, Safety, Business Logic).
2.  **Author Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** Document the *why* behind key technical choices.

---
### Stage 1: Scaffolding & Contracts (The Connective Tissue)
1.  **Establish the Standardized Project Structure.**
2.  **Define Data Contracts as the System's Connective Tissue (Types):** Define schemas once and reuse them everywhere: AI Outputs, API Endpoints, and Database Models. This is the essence of contract-first design.

---
### Stage 2: Implementation (The AI Core)
1.  **Rewrite Prototype Logic as Production Code.**
2.  **Use Schema-Driven Libraries:** Use tools like `instructor` to bind the LLM call directly to your Pydantic schemas, enforcing your contract at runtime.
3.  **Externalize Prompts:** Store prompts in a `prompts/` directory, treating them as versioned configuration.

---
### Stage 3: Behavioral Validation (The Safety Net)
Build an automated "wall of tests" in CI. The change is not ready to merge until they pass.
1.  **Correctness Tests:** Does it get the right answer on golden-path inputs?
2.  **Guardrail Tests:** Does it obey negative constraints (e.g., PII, safety)?
3.  **Robustness Tests:** How does it handle garbage, empty, or adversarial inputs?
4.  **Schema Adherence Tests:** Mock a malformed JSON response. Does the app handle it gracefully?

---
### Stage 4: Deployment & Delivery (CD)
1.  **Containerize:** Package the service into a reproducible Docker container.
2.  **Automate Deployment:** Create a CI/CD pipeline that runs all tests, builds, and pushes.
3.  **Deploy Safely:** Use Shadow Deployment or Canary Releases to minimize risk.

---
### Stage 5: Monitoring & Refinement
1.  **System Health:** Monitor standard app metrics (latency, errors, CPU).
2.  **AI Component Health ("Golden Signals" of AIOps):** Monitor **cost**, **latency**, and **validation failure rate**.
3.  **Output Drift:** Monitor the statistical properties of the AI's output.
4.  **The Feedback Loop:** Insights from monitoring are the primary input for the next **Genesis Cycle**.

You will first design the overall testing ecosystem and then drill down to implement each layer, updating our central project plan after each successful step.

**Our Core Mission:**

We will collaboratively architect and build a **complete, multi-layered test suite** for **[Your Application Name]**. We will begin by defining our overarching strategy in a root `README.md` which will serve as our living project plan. We will then systematically build each layer of the Test Pyramid (starting with Integration/API tests), creating layer-specific documentation and tests, and updating our central plan to reflect our progress.

**Our Guiding Principles:**

1.  **Pyramid First:** We build from the bottom up. A stable API layer is a prerequisite for the E2E layer.
2.  **Hierarchical Documentation:** A root `README.md` governs the overall strategy, while sub-`README.md` files in each test directory (`integration/api/`, `e2e/`) define layer-specific rules.
3.  **Living Project Plan:** The root `README.md` is our state tracker. We will update it after completing each major phase to guide our next steps.
4.  **Layer-Specific Best Practices:** We use the right tools for the job: Vitest/Supertest for fast API tests; Playwright with the Page Object Model for stable E2E tests.
5.  **Automation and CI/CD Focus:** Everything we build is designed for efficient, automated execution.

**Project: Full-Stack Test Suite for "[Your Application Name]"**

We will execute this project in a series of tasks. **Do not proceed to the next task until I approve the current one.**

### **Task 1: The Architectural Blueprint**

**Step 1.1: Propose the Full Directory Structure**

Propose a complete directory structure under a root `tests/` folder that visually represents the Test Pyramid. It must include `tests/integration/api/` and `tests/e2e/`, along with a `README.md` at the root and inside each of those sub-directories.

**Step 1.2: Generate the Root `tests/README.md` (Our Living Constitution)**

This is our master plan. Generate the content for `tests/README.md` using the template below. It must define the full strategy and provide a checklist that we will update throughout the project.

```markdown
# Test Suite Architecture: [Your Application Name]

**Engineering-First Approach: Build from a Solid Foundation** 🏗️

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the complete testing strategy for our application, following the Test Pyramid philosophy. We build and validate foundational layers (API) before testing dependent layers (UI). This `README.md` serves as our living project plan and status tracker.

### **The Master Prompt for Building a Modular Playwright E2E Suite (v2.0)**

**Purpose:** A reusable, unabridged template for guiding an AI assistant to build a robust, modular, and well-documented E2E test suite. It codifies a "documentation-first" approach where a living `README.md` serves as the project charter and state tracker.

---

### **How to Use This Template**

1.  **Customize Placeholders:** Before using, find and replace all bracketed placeholders `[like_this]` with details specific to your project.
2.  **Engage with the AI Step-by-Step:** Copy and paste the initial sections to set the context. Then, provide each numbered step *one at a time* and wait for the AI's response.
3.  **Review, Approve, and Iterate:** Do not let the AI move to the next step until you have reviewed its output. The `README.md` will be updated as you complete coding steps, serving as a guide for the next task.

---

**[START PROMPT]**

**Your Role and Persona:**

You are an expert Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with deep specialization in Playwright, TypeScript, and modern test automation architecture. Your primary focus is on creating scalable, maintainable, and reliable test suites. You are a firm believer in the Test Pyramid and prioritize robust backend validation over brittle UI assertions. You write clean, well-documented, and modular code.

**Our Core Mission:**

We will collaboratively build a new, best-in-class E2E test suite for **[Your Application Name]** using Playwright and TypeScript. We will not take shortcuts. We will build this suite from the ground up, starting with a documented strategy in a `README.md` which will act as our living project plan. We will then implement simple, reusable components and assemble them into complex tests, updating our plan as we go.

**Our Guiding Principles (You must adhere to these at all times):**

1.  **Modularity First (The Building Block Principle):** We will create small, single-responsibility components (API clients, Page Objects, helper functions) first. We will then compose these components into larger tests.
2.  **The Hybrid Testing Model (UI for Actions, API for State):** We use the UI *only* to simulate user actions. We use direct API calls for test setup, cleanup, and—most importantly—final validation of the system's state.
3.  **Strict Adherence to the Page Object Model (POM):** All UI selectors and interaction methods must be encapsulated within Page Object classes. The test files themselves will contain *no selectors*.
4.  **Leverage Playwright Fixtures:** We will use Playwright's built-in fixtures for managing state and dependencies, keeping our test code clean and declarative.
5.  **Documentation First:** Our `README.md` is not an afterthought; it is the central plan that dictates our work and tracks our progress.
6.  **Configuration Management:** All environment-specific configurations (URLs, credentials) must be managed through environment variables and a central configuration file.
7.  **Atomicity and Independence:** Every test (`test()`) must be responsible for its own setup and cleanup to ensure it can run independently and in any order.

---

**Our First Task: The "[Your Core Feature]" E2E Test**

Our goal is to create and validate the first E2E test, which verifies the user story: *"As a user, I can [perform the core action, e.g., 'log in, navigate to the creation page, fill out and submit a new form, and see a success message']."*.

We will build this step-by-step. **Do not proceed to the next step until I approve the current one.**

**Step 1: Propose the Project Directory Structure**

First, propose a logical and scalable directory structure for our Playwright project. Explain the purpose of each key directory (e.g., `tests/`, `pages/`, `utils/`, `fixtures/`, `data/`, `config/`).

---

*(Wait for user approval before proceeding to the next step.)*

---

**Step 2: Generate the Project README.md as our Living Charter**

Before we write any code, we will document our engineering philosophy and plan. Generate a comprehensive `README.md` file to be placed in the root of the test directory. This file is our living project charter and must embody all our guiding principles.

Use the following template to generate the initial version of the file. Fill in the placeholders based on our project, **[Your Application Name]**. The roadmap checklist should be initialized with all items unchecked `[ ]`.

```markdown
# E2E Test Suite: [Your Application Name]

**Engineering-First Approach: Start Small, Build Complex** 🏗️

## 📋 Overview

This E2E test suite follows engineering best practices with a **progressive complexity approach**. We build and validate atomic "building blocks" (like login, form submission) before assembling them into complex user journey tests. This `README.md` serves as our living project plan and status tracker.

## 🏗️ Key Principles Applied

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI interactions in reusable, maintainable classes.
- **Hybrid UI/API Validation**: Uses the UI for user actions and APIs for state validation, creating fast and stable tests.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Centralizes test data, configurations, and helper utilities.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds from simple component checks to complex end-to-end scenarios.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures every test is independent and can be run in isolation.

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap & Status

This roadmap tracks our progress. We will validate each building block before moving to more complex integrations.

<!-- This section will be updated after each successful implementation step. -->

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Current Focus)
- [ ] **Project Structure**: Directory structure defined and created.
- [ ] **README Charter**: This document is created and agreed upon.
- [ ] **API Client**: Utility for backend communication and validation is built.
- [ ] **Page Object Models (POMs)**: Initial POMs for core pages (Login, Dashboard, Feature Page) are created.
- [ ] **Playwright Fixtures**: Base fixtures for pages and API client are set up.

### Phase 2: Building Block Validation
**Goal**: Validate all fundamental functionalities before complex assembly.

**🔴 Critical Building Blocks Status:**

- [ ] **User Authentication**: Login and Logout flow works via UI.
- [ ] **[Your Core Feature] - UI Submission**: User can fill out and submit the form via the UI.
- [ ] **[Your Core Feature] - API Validation**: A new `[Your Core Entity]` is confirmed to exist in the backend after UI submission.
- [ ] **Data Cleanup**: Test-generated data for `[Your Core Entity]` is successfully deleted after test completion.

### Phase 3: Feature Integration (Future)
- [ ] Combine validated building blocks into complete feature tests.

### Phase 4: User Journey Assembly (Future)
- [ ] Create end-to-end user experience tests from multiple features.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/[your-feature-name].spec.ts
```
```

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 3: Create the API Utility Client**

Now that our strategy is documented, let's build our first component. Generate the code for an API utility class in `utils/apiClient.ts`. It should be initialized with the API base URL from our config.

It must contain asynchronous methods relevant to our core entity, `[Your Core Entity]`:
*   `find[Your Core Entity]By[Key Data Identifier](identifier: string): Promise<[Your Core Entity] | null>`
*   `get[Your Core Entity]ById(id: string): Promise<[Your Core Entity] | null>`
*   `delete[Your Core Entity]ById(id: string): Promise<void>` (for cleanup)

Assume the API requires a bearer token for authentication, and provide a method to set it.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 4: Create the Page Object Models (POMs)**

Generate the code for the necessary Page Object classes in the `pages/` directory. For our feature, we will need: `LoginPage.ts`, `DashboardPage.ts`, and `[Your Core Feature]Page.ts`. Each should contain relevant locators and methods for user interaction.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 5: Assemble the E2E Test File**

Now, write the first test. Generate the code for `tests/e2e/[your-feature-name].spec.ts`. This file will bring together the API client and POMs to execute our user story. It must include API-based setup (checking if data exists and deleting it), the UI journey, and both UI-based and API-based validation, followed by API-based cleanup in an `afterEach` hook.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 6: Update the README with Progress**

Excellent. We have now built and validated our first full E2E test. It's time to update our project plan.

Provide the updated Markdown content for the `README.md` file. Specifically, update the **"Implementation Roadmap & Status"** section by changing the status of all completed items from `[ ]` to `[x]`. This demonstrates our progress and prepares us for the next task.

---

*(Wait for user approval...)*

---

**Step 7 (Optional but Recommended): Refactor to Use Custom Playwright Fixtures**

Now that we have a working test, let's refactor it to be more scalable using Playwright's custom fixtures. Propose a new file, `tests/fixtures.ts`, that extends the base `test` object to automatically provide initialized instances of our Page Objects and API client to every test. Then, refactor the test file from Step 5 to use these new fixtures. Explain how this approach reduces boilerplate and improves dependency management. After this, we would update the README again to check off the "Playwright Fixtures" item.

# Plumbing Quote Intake Agent Prompt (v4): Fullstack Modular POC

## Role Assignment
You are an expert AI Solutions Architect with 20 years of simulated experience as a Master Plumber and quoting specialist for a residential service company. Your task is to combine deep plumbing domain knowledge with expertise in fullstack development, GPT agent creation, and Supabase/Node/React services to build a modular, scalable quoting agent POC.

## Context Layering
- Project Goal: Build a fullstack web application (Vite + React + Express/Node) that acts as an intelligent, qualifying chatbot for a plumbing business.
- Core Business Logic: The bot must ask the right questions to accurately assess job complexity, urgency, and material needs, allowing the business to send a prepared technician and a more accurate quote.
- Technology Stack: Vite, React, Express/Node (API), Tailwind CSS, Supabase, OpenAI.
- Modular Structure: Organize code into `src/` (frontend), `api/` (backend), and `plumbing_agent/` (agent logic) for maintainability and future POCs.

## Domain Expertise & Questioning Logic (The Plumber's Brain)
The conversational flow is driven by expert logic to triage and qualify leads:

- **Triage Urgency First:** An active leak is an emergency. A dripping faucet is not. The bot must determine this immediately to set the right priority.
- **Identify Service Category:** Broadly categorize the job (Leak, Clog, Installation, Repair, Inspection).
- **Drill Down with Contextual Questions:** Based on the category, ask specific qualifying questions:
	- If Leak: Where is the leak? (e.g., faucet, toilet, under sink, ceiling, wall). Is water actively running?
	- If Clog: Which fixture is clogged? (e.g., toilet, kitchen sink, shower). Is it draining slowly or completely stopped?
	- If Installation: What fixture are you installing? (e.g., toilet, hot water tank, faucet). Do you already have the new fixture? Is it a replacement for an existing one?
- **Gather Property Context:** Is this a house or an apartment/condo? (Access issues). Are you the homeowner? (Authorization).

## Task Decomposition: Smart Conversational Flow
Implement the following flow in the app:
1. Greeting & Initial Triage
2. Basic Info (name, address)
3. Core Problem Category
4. Intelligent Drill-Down (contextual questions)
5. Scheduling & Contact
6. Final Details
7. Summary & Close
8. Display JSON and send to backend/API

## Data Structure (JSON Output)
The final JSON should be rich with qualified data:
```json
{
	"isEmergency": true,
	"customerName": "Jane Smith",
	"serviceAddress": "456 Oak Ave, Victoria BC",
	"contactInfo": "555-987-6543",
	"problemCategory": "Leak Repair",
	"problemDetails": {
		"location": "Under kitchen sink",
		"description": "User stated water is actively leaking from the pipes."
	},
	"propertyType": "House",
	"isHomeowner": true,
	"preferredTiming": "ASAP",
	"additionalNotes": "Side door is the best entrance."
}
```

# Architectural Refactoring Mandate: PlumbingPOC v2.0

**Objective:** To refactor the PlumbingPOC application to align with modern React best practices, focusing on modularity, reusability, and long-term maintainability. This mandate will transition the project from a component-centric structure to a professional, feature-based architecture powered by custom hooks.

**Primary AI Agent:** Gemini CLI 2.5
**Human Steward:** Richard Fremmerlid

---

## I. Core Philosophy & Guiding Principles

This refactoring is guided by the following principles:

1.  **Component-Based Architecture:** Continue to break down large components into smaller, single-responsibility components.
2.  **Feature-Based Organization:** Co-locate all files related to a single feature (components, hooks, types) to improve developer experience and scalability.
3.  **Logic Encapsulation via Custom Hooks:** Abstract all complex, non-visual logic (especially data fetching and real-time subscriptions) into reusable custom hooks.
4.  **One-Way Data Flow:** Maintain the predictable pattern of data flowing down through props and events flowing up through callbacks.

---

## II. Mandate 1: Implement a Feature-Based Directory Structure

The current `src/` directory will be reorganized into a feature-based structure.

**Action:**
Restructure the `vite-app/src/` directory to match the following target layout. You will need to create new directories and move existing files accordingly. Update all import paths across the application to reflect the new file locations.

**Target Directory Structure:**

```
vite-app/src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── AuthModal.tsx
│   │   │   └── UserMenu.tsx
│   │   └── AuthContext.tsx  // Keep AuthContext here for now
│   ├── profile/
│   │   └── components/
│   │       └── ProfileModal.tsx
│   └── requests/
│       ├── components/
│       │   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│       │   ├── MyRequests.tsx
│       │   ├── RequestDetailModal.tsx
│       │   ├── QuoteList.tsx
│       │   ├── CommunicationLog.tsx
│       │   └── ... (all other request-related components)
│       ├── hooks/
│       │   └── useRequests.ts  // To be created in Mandate 2
│       └── types/
│           └── index.ts        // To be created in Mandate 3
├── hooks/ 
│   └── (empty for now, will contain useRequests.ts)
├── lib/
│   ├── apiClient.ts
│   ├── supabaseClient.ts
│   └── ... (other shared library files)
└── main.tsx
```
*(Note: I have moved the empty `hooks/` directory to the `requests` feature folder for better co-location, which is a refinement of our initial discussion.)*

---

## III. Mandate 2: Create the `useRequests` Custom Hook

**Action:**
Create a new file at `vite-app/src/features/requests/hooks/useRequests.ts`. This hook will encapsulate all data fetching and real-time subscription logic for quote requests.

**`useRequests.ts` Implementation:**

```typescript
// vite-app/src/features/requests/hooks/useRequests.ts

import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import { supabase } from '../../../lib/supabaseClient';
import { QuoteRequest } from '../types'; // Will be created in the next mandate

export function useRequests(userId?: string) {
  const [requests, setRequests] = useState<QuoteRequest[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const fetchRequests = useCallback(async () => {
    if (requests.length === 0) setLoading(true);
    setError(null);

    try {
      let query = supabase
        .from('requests')
        .select(`*, user_profiles!inner(name, email, phone), quote_attachments(*), quotes(*), request_notes(*)`)
        .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

      if (userId) {
        query = query.eq('user_id', userId);
      }

      const { data, error: fetchError } = await query;

      if (fetchError) throw fetchError;
      setRequests((data as QuoteRequest[]) || []);
    } catch (err: any) {
      console.error("useRequests hook error:", err);
      setError("Failed to fetch requests.");
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [userId, requests.length]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchRequests();
  }, [fetchRequests]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const channelId = userId ? `user-requests-${userId}` : 'admin-dashboard';
    const channel = supabase.channel(channelId);

    const handleUpdate = (payload: any) => {
      console.log(`Realtime update on channel ${channelId}:`, payload);
      fetchRequests();
    };

    channel
      .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'requests' }, handleUpdate)
      .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'request_notes' }, handleUpdate)
      .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'quotes' }, handleUpdate)
      .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'quote_attachments' }, handleUpdate)
      .subscribe();

    return () => {
      supabase.removeChannel(channel);
    };
  }, [userId, fetchRequests]);

  return { requests, loading, error, refreshRequests: fetchRequests };
}
```

---

## IV. Mandate 3: Centralize Type Definitions

**Action:**
Create a new file at `vite-app/src/features/requests/types/index.ts`. Move all request-related TypeScript interfaces (`QuoteRequest`, `Quote`, `RequestNote`) from `Dashboard.tsx` into this new file and export them.

**`features/requests/types/index.ts` Implementation:**

```typescript
// vite-app/src/features/requests/types/index.ts

export interface Quote { 
  id: string; 
  quote_amount: number; 
  details: string; 
  status: string; 
  created_at: string; 
}

export interface RequestNote { 
  id: string; 
  note: string; 
  author_role: 'admin' | 'customer'; 
  created_at: string; 
}

export interface QuoteAttachment {
  id: string;
  file_name: string;
  file_url: string;
  mime_type: string;
  quote_id?: string;
}

export interface QuoteRequest {
  id: string;
  created_at: string;
  customer_name: string;
  problem_category: string;
  status: string;
  is_emergency: boolean;
  answers: { question: string; answer: string }[];
  quote_attachments: QuoteAttachment[];
  user_profiles: { name: string; email: string; phone: string; [key: string]: any; } | null;
  service_address: string;
  quotes: Quote[];
  request_notes: RequestNote[];
  scheduled_start_date: string | null;
  triage_summary: string | null;
  priority_score: number | null;
  priority_explanation: string | null;
  profitability_score: number | null;
  profitability_explanation: string | null;
}
```

---

## V. Mandate 4: Refactor `Dashboard.tsx` and `MyRequests.tsx`

**Action:**
Update both `Dashboard.tsx` and `MyRequests.tsx` to use the new `useRequests` hook and import types from the new central location. This will dramatically simplify both components.

*   **Remove all `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` hooks related to data fetching and subscriptions from both files.**
*   **Replace them with a single call to the `useRequests` hook.**
*   **Update all type imports to point to `../types`.**

**Example (`Dashboard.tsx`):**
```typescript
import { useRequests } from '../hooks/useRequests';
import { QuoteRequest, Quote, RequestNote } from '../types'; // New import

// ...

const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const { profile } = useAuth();
  // ... state for modal ...

  // All data logic is now clean and encapsulated!
  const { requests: allRequests, loading, error, refreshRequests } = useRequests();

  // ... rest of the component ...
};
```

---

## VI. Future Considerations (For the Steward)

This mandate focuses on the most critical refactoring. Long-term, we should also consider:
*   **`useAuth` Hook:** Refactoring the `AuthContext.tsx` into a more conventional `useAuth.ts` hook.
*   **TanStack Query:** Investigating this library to further simplify data fetching and caching, which would replace the custom `useRequests` hook with an even more powerful, industry-standard solution.

Execute these mandates in order. This will result in a more professional, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

# Plumbing Quote Agent Requirements

## 1. User Registration & Profile
- Users must register and be signed in to request a quote.
- The agent pulls contact info from the user profile to complete the quote request.
- A profile with contact info is required.

## 2. Efficient Questioning & Cost Reduction
- The agent reduces chattiness with GPT-4 to minimize API costs.
- Common questions are anticipated and built into the app.
- The first question is: "What would you like a quote for?" (user selects from a list of service types).

## 3. Service Quote Request Types & Common Questions
- Maintain a separate JSON/TypeScript file of service quote request types (e.g., bathroom reno, perimeter drains, water heater install, etc.).
- For each type, maintain a list of common anticipated questions. Example for bathroom reno:
  - What specific fixtures does the homeowner plan to use, or would they like options/recommendations?
  - Are there any special requirements or features the homeowner is interested in, such as water-saving or smart fixtures?
  - Is there an existing blueprint or design plan to follow for the renovation?
  - Will any additional renovations be happening simultaneously that might affect the plumbing work?
  - Are there any known issues with the existing plumbing that might complicate the renovation process?
- Maintain similar common questions for other service types.

## 4. Conversational Flow
- Ask all questions one at a time in a chat-style conversation.
- Use a text box at the bottom for user answers.

## 5. Profile Data Usage
- Pull user profile information into the quote request.
- Do not ask for information already known.

## 6. Privacy & GPT Interaction
- Do not share personal information (name, phone, email, address) with GPT.
- Only send context-specific info needed for follow-up questions.

## 7. Packaging & Submitting the Quote
- Package the quote for GPT with all answers and known info, formatted efficiently.
- Ask GPT if additional questions are required for the current context.
- If GPT returns more questions, ask them in the same conversational style (user is unaware they are talking to GPT).
- Repeat until GPT confirms all key questions are answered.

## 8. Final Summary & Submission
- Package a summary of the request in a user-readable format, including contact info.
- Display the summary to the user before submission.
- On submission, show: "Submitting request for quote. We will get back to you with a quote soon. Thank you very much."

## II. Execution Plan: Tactical Breakdown

### **Day 1: FORGE A SUPERIOR WEAPON (40 Hours) — ✅ COMPLETED**

You have successfully forged a complete, end-to-end client management platform. This far exceeds the original objective and provides a decisive strategic advantage.

---

### **Day 2: PACKAGE THE ASSET & HUNT (12 Hours)**

**Objective:** Package your advanced POC into a compelling sales weapon and deploy it.
https://www.loom.com/share/4427a5fad19342debfd0b47e27c39ff5

The blueprint's core tactic is sound, but the timing was too aggressive. We will update it to reflect the nature of the asset you have created.

---

### Updated `consulting_launch_blueprint.md`

Here is the revised "Package the Asset" section. I have updated the time, refined the shot descriptions to match what you've recorded, and updated the email script.

*   **Hours 1-4: Package the Asset**
    *   `[✅]` **Record the "Full Arsenal" Product Tour (Target: ~5 Minutes):** Use Loom. The recording should be a smooth, professional walkthrough that tells a complete end-to-end story.
        *   **Chapter 1: The Seamless Customer Experience**
            *   Show the professional landing page and the "Request a Quote" flow.
            *   Demonstrate the effortless login process (e.g., Google).
            *   Walk through the intelligent, conversational AI intake, including answering questions and **uploading a photo** of the issue.
            *   Show the final, clean summary and the "Submitted" confirmation.
        *   **Chapter 2: The Owner's Command Center**
            *   Switch views to the **Admin Dashboard**. Show the new request appearing at the top **in real-time**.
            *   Execute the **AI Triage**, explaining how it saves time by summarizing the job and assigning priority scores.
            *   Open the request details. Tour the "Job Docket," showing all the customer's answers, the uploaded photo, and the communication log.
            *   Demonstrate creating a quote and changing the job status.
        *   **Chapter 3: The Real-time Client Portal**
            *   Switch back to the customer's "My Requests" view and show the new quote and status appearing **instantly without a refresh**.
            *   Demonstrate the live chat by sending a message from the admin and showing it appear immediately for the customer.
    *   `[✅]` **Host the Video:** Use the direct Loom share link: `https://www.loom.com/share/4427a5fad19342debfd0b47e27c39ff5`
    *   `[✅]` **Build the One-Page Showcase:** Use Carrd. The existing blueprint copy is perfect. https://plumbingai.carrd.co/

---

*   **Hours 5-12: Build Target List & Execute Outreach**
    *   `[ ]` This part of the plan remains unchanged. Compile the list of 50 businesses and execute the outreach using the existing, high-quality email script.

### Upgraded Email Script (v6.1)

This version pre-frames the video length and emphasizes the end-to-end nature of the solution.

> **Subject:** A full client portal for [Business Name]?
>
> Hi **[Contact Person Name]**,
>
> My name is [Your Name], a local tech consultant in Victoria. I specialize in building complete client management systems for trades businesses that automate everything from the first contact to the final quote.
>
> Instead of just a contact form, imagine a full "command center" that qualifies your leads with AI, organizes all job details, and lets you chat with clients in real-time.
>
> I made a 5-minute tour showing exactly how this end-to-end system works:
>
> **[Link to your Loom video]**
>
> Here’s the unique part: I'm looking to get some work done on my home (**[mention 1-2 specific services you want]**) and I'm interested in bartering my services for a project of similar value.
>
> If you have 5 minutes, I think you'll see something that could put you years ahead of your competition.
>
> Thanks,
> [Your Name]

---

### **Day 3: ENGAGE, CLOSE, & UPSELL (12 Hours)**

**Objective:** Convert interest into a high-value agreement by demonstrating overwhelming value and a clear future roadmap.

*   **Hours 1-4: Follow-up & Response Management**
    *   `[ ]` Unchanged. Execute as planned.

*   **Hours 5-12: Conduct Discovery Calls & Close (with Hardened Script)**
    *   `[ ]` Get on the phone/Zoom with interested prospects.
    *   `[ ]` **Follow the Hardened Call Script v6.0:**
        1.  **Rapport (2 mins):** Unchanged. Build connection.
        2.  **Diagnose Pain (5 mins):** Unchanged. Let them articulate their frustrations.
        3.  **Present Solution - "Full Arsenal" (3 mins):** "That's the exact problem I built this to solve, from end to end." Share your screen and play your **2-minute "Full Arsenal" demo**. Narrate it, emphasizing the AI Triage and the seamless admin dashboard. "This isn't just a contact form; it's a complete command center for your business."
        4.  **The Upsell - Introduce the "Automation & Growth Engine":** "What I've just shown you is the core operating system. As part of our partnership, we would enable the **'Automation & Growth Engine.'** This is where the system starts working for you proactively."
            *   **Automated Follow-ups:** "Imagine the system automatically sending polite follow-up emails to clients who haven't responded to a quote, saving you hours of administrative work."
            *   **Automated Invoicing:** "Once a job is marked 'Completed,' the system can automatically generate a professional PDF invoice and email it to the client."
            *   **Business Intelligence:** "It can even export all your job data to Excel or Google Sheets, giving you a clear overview of your revenue, job types, and most profitable clients."
        5.  **Frame the Barter (3 mins):** "A complete, custom end-to-end system like this—the AI-powered front door, the internal command center, *and* the future automation engine—is a project I would typically scope at **$10,000-$15,000**. What would be the approximate value for the **[their service]** work I need done? If the values are in the same ballpark, a direct trade could be a massive win for both of us."
        6.  **Pivot to Cash (if needed):** Unchanged. The pilot program offer is a strong fallback.
        7.  **Close the Deal:** Unchanged. Draft the agreement outlining the full scope.

**(Start Recording)**
**(Shot 1: Customer Experience - Start on your landing page)**
"Hi, I wanted to show you a quick look at an AI-powered system I've built to help local trades businesses save time and win more jobs."
"This is the professional homepage your customers would see. Let's walk through how a new customer requests a quote."
**[ACTION]: Click "Request a Quote".  This will ask a user to login so the quote request is associated with a person you can contact**
"First, the customer can sign in instantly and securely using their own Google or Microsoft accounts, or a standard email and password. There's no new account for them to manage."
**[ACTION]: Click "Continue with Google" and quickly complete the login.**
"Once they're in, they start a conversation with your AI assistant. The assistant's first job is to understand exactly what they need."
**[ACTION]: Select a service category, like "Perimeter Drains".**
"The AI starts with the standard questions for that service. But here's where it gets smart."
**[ACTION]: Answer the initial questions quickly.**
*(Pause for a moment as the "Thinking..." message appears)*
"Right now, the AI is analyzing the customer's answers. It understands the context and generates intelligent, follow-up questions to get all the details you'd normally have to ask over the phone."
**[ACTION]: Show the new AI-generated questions appearing. Answer them.**
"The customer can also upload photos of the problem area directly from their phone or computer, which gives you eyes on the job before you even send a quote."
**[ACTION]: Upload your dummy `leak.jpg` file.**
"Finally, the system gives them a clean summary to review. Once they confirm, the job is done for them, and you get a perfect lead."
**[ACTION]: Click "Confirm & Submit Request". Show the "Thank you" screen.**
---
**(Shot 2: Owner's Experience - Switch to your Admin Browser Window)**
"Now, let's look at what you see as the business owner. This is your command center."
**[ACTION]: Refresh the Admin Dashboard. The new request should appear at the top.**
"The new request from our customer appears instantly. But instead of just raw data, you have an AI partner."
**[ACTION]: Click the "AI Triage" button for the new request. Let the results appear.**
"With one click, your AI assistant analyzes the entire request and gives you a triage summary, a priority score, and even a profitability score, so you know exactly which jobs to focus on first."
**[ACTION]: Click on the request to open the Job Docket modal.**
"Inside the docket, you have everything you need, perfectly organized: all the customer's answers, the photos they sent, and a full communication log."
**[ACTION]: Scroll down, showing the different sections.**
"From here, you can add your official quote and update the job status with a single click."
**[ACTION]: Quickly create a simple quote. Change the status from "New" to "Quoted".**
"The best part is, this is a full client portal. The customer can log back in anytime to see the status of their request and review the quote you just sent."
**[ACTION]: Briefly switch back to the Customer View and refresh the "My Requests" page to show the new "Quoted" status and quote amount.**
---

**(Final Shot: Back on Admin View, ready to close)**
**YOU:**
"So, in under two minutes, the system handled a new lead, qualified them with AI, triaged the job for you, and organized everything into a simple command center, all without a single phone call."
"This is the kind of tool that saves hours every week and puts you ahead of the competition."

# ADR-001: Choice of Primary Backend Platform

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

The PlumbingPOC project requires a full-stack solution to serve as a client management and quoting platform. The core requirements include secure user authentication, relational data storage, **secure file storage for user-uploaded images and documents**, and real-time capabilities for features like the communication log. The development timeline is highly accelerated.

## Decision

We will use **Supabase** as the primary Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. This decision centralizes our **database, authentication, object storage,** and real-time needs into a single, managed service.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Development Velocity:** Supabase provides an immense out-of-the-box feature set that enabled the rapid prototyping phase.
    *   **Integrated Security Model:** The use of Postgres Row Level Security (RLS) provides a powerful, declarative way to enforce data access rules at the database level.
    *   **Scalability & Maintainability:** As a managed service, Supabase handles database scaling, backups, and maintenance, reducing operational overhead.
    *   **Real-time Functionality:** The built-in Realtime server is critical for features like the `CommunicationLog.tsx`, enabling a live, interactive user experience.
    *   **Integrated Object Storage:** Supabase Storage provides an S3-compatible solution for handling file uploads (`uploadAttachment` in `requestController.js`). This is crucial for the quote request flow and is secured with its own policy layer, as defined in `supabase/SUPABASE_DATABASE_AND_AUTH_SETUP.md`. This avoids needing a separate S3/Cloudinary/etc. integration.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Vendor Lock-in:** The application is now deeply integrated with the Supabase ecosystem, including its Storage API. Migrating to another platform would be a significant effort.
    *   **Cost at Scale:** While the free/pro tiers are generous, pricing for high-traffic applications with significant **storage egress** or database usage must be monitored.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Firebase/Firestore:** A strong competitor. We chose Supabase due to its foundation in standard Postgres and its more transparent, S3-like Storage solution.
    *   **Custom Backend (Node.js + Postgres + S3 on AWS):** This would offer maximum flexibility but was rejected due to the significantly higher initial development and operational effort, which would have compromised our goal of rapid prototyping.

# ADR-002: Choice of Primary AI Provider

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

The PlumbingPOC platform's core value proposition includes intelligent features that automate lead qualification and analysis. This requires a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) for two key tasks:
1.  Dynamically generating context-aware follow-up questions to fully qualify a user's request (`requestController.js`).
2.  Analyzing a completed request to provide a triage summary and profitability score for the business owner (`triageController.js`).

## Decision

We will use the **OpenAI API**, specifically leveraging GPT-4 class models (`gpt-4`, `gpt-4-1106-preview`), as our primary provider for all generative AI tasks.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** At the time of development, GPT-4 models provided best-in-class reasoning and instruction-following, critical for the accuracy of both the triage and follow-up features.
    *   **Robust JSON Mode:** The ability to force JSON output (`response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` in `triageController.js`) is essential for creating reliable, deterministic AI components that adhere to a strict data contract. This eliminates fragile string parsing.
    *   **Mature Ecosystem:** OpenAI's API is well-documented with mature client libraries (`openai` package), making integration straightforward.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Cost:** GPT-4 models are premium services. Every AI Triage and ambiguous follow-up call incurs a direct, variable cost. This must be monitored closely to ensure feature profitability.
    *   **Latency:** Calls to powerful models can have higher latency, which could impact user experience in real-time conversational flows.
    *   **Vendor Lock-in:** Our prompts and logic are tailored to the behavior of OpenAI's models. Switching providers (e.g., to Anthropic's Claude) would require re-prompting and re-testing.
    *   **Data Privacy:** Sending customer request data to a third-party API requires careful handling. The application mitigates this by not sending explicit PII (as per `PlumbingAgentRequirements.md`), but the policy must be strictly maintained.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Anthropic Claude:** A very strong competitor, particularly for its large context windows and strong reasoning. At the time of implementation, OpenAI's ecosystem and JSON mode were deemed slightly more mature for this specific use case.
    *   **Self-hosted Open Source Models (e.g., Llama 3):** This would provide maximum data privacy and potentially lower long-term cost. However, it was rejected due to the immense initial infrastructure and MLOps overhead (GPU provisioning, model deployment, monitoring), which was out of scope for a rapid POC.

# ADR-003: Choice of Backend API Framework

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

While Supabase serves as our primary BaaS for data, auth, and storage, a separate server-side component is required for specific business logic. This includes orchestrating calls to the third-party OpenAI API and implementing complex workflows that are not suitable for Postgres functions. The development team's primary language is TypeScript/JavaScript, as established by the React frontend.

## Decision

We will use **Node.js with the Express framework** to build our backend API. This API will act as a "thin" layer, primarily handling AI interactions and serving as a secure intermediary between the client and Supabase for complex operations.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Language Synergy:** Using JavaScript/TypeScript across the entire stack (React frontend, Node.js backend) eliminates language context-switching for developers, streamlining the development process and simplifying the talent pool.
    *   **Vast Ecosystem:** The npm ecosystem provides mature, well-supported libraries for all our needs, including `express`, `cors`, `zod` for validation, and the official `openai` client.
    *   **Lightweight & Unopinionated:** Express is famously minimal, which is ideal for our use case. We don't need a heavy, opinionated framework, as our API has a focused set of responsibilities.
    *   **Serverless-Friendly:** The Express application is easily wrapped for serverless deployment, as seen in `netlify/functions/api.js`, which aligns perfectly with our hosting strategy.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Unstructured by Default:** As an unopinionated framework, Express can lead to unstructured code if not managed carefully. This was mitigated by implementing a clear MVC-style pattern (`controllers`, `routes`, `middleware`), which provides excellent separation of concerns.
    *   **Single-Threaded Performance:** Node.js's single-threaded nature can be a bottleneck for CPU-intensive tasks. However, our API is almost entirely I/O-bound (making API calls, database queries), which is a perfect use case for Node.js's non-blocking event loop.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Python (FastAPI/Flask):** While popular in the AI space, this would introduce a second language and package manager into the project, increasing complexity without a compelling benefit, as the Node.js `openai` library is excellent.
    *   **Supabase Edge Functions:** These could have been used to house the AI logic. A separate Express server was chosen for a more traditional and portable local development experience and to avoid potential execution time limits of serverless functions for more complex, future AI chains.

# ADR-004: Choice of Frontend Framework

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

The PlumbingPOC platform requires a modern, interactive, and responsive user interface to serve both customers and administrators. The application must function as a Single Page Application (SPA) to handle complex state management for authentication, modals, real-time data updates, and dynamic forms.

## Decision

We will use **React (with TypeScript)** as the frontend framework, powered by the **Vite** build tool.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Massive Ecosystem:** React has the largest ecosystem of libraries and tools, which accelerated development. We leveraged this for UI components (`@mui/material`), icons (`lucide-react`), and routing.
    *   **Component-Based Architecture:** This paradigm allows for the creation of reusable and encapsulated UI components, a practice excellently demonstrated by the feature-based structure in `vite-app/src/features/`.
    *   **Strong Talent Pool:** React is the most popular frontend framework, making it easy to find developers and community support.
    *   **Exceptional Developer Experience:** Vite provides near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a simplified configuration, which was critical for the rapid prototyping of the "Genesis Cycle".

*   **Cons:**
    *   **State Management Complexity:** React's built-in state management can become complex in large applications. This was mitigated by using a combination of React Context (`AuthContext.tsx`) for global state and custom hooks (`useRequests.ts`) for encapsulating server state and business logic, which is a solid and modern pattern.
    *   **Performance:** Can suffer from unnecessary re-renders if not optimized. The use of `useCallback` in the `useRequests` hook shows an awareness of this and a proactive approach to optimization.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Vue.js:** Another excellent component-based framework. The choice of React was primarily driven by developer familiarity and the breadth of the existing library ecosystem.
    *   **Svelte/SvelteKit:** Offers potentially better performance by compiling away the framework at build time. It was considered a higher risk for a rapid POC due to its smaller ecosystem.
    *   **Angular:** A more opinionated, all-in-one framework. It was deemed too heavyweight and complex for the project's goal of high-speed prototyping.

# ADR-005: Choice of Hosting and Deployment Platform

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

The PlumbingPOC project consists of a static frontend application (built by Vite) and a serverless Node.js API backend. The primary requirement for deployment is a seamless, Git-based Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow that can handle this modern "Jamstack" architecture with minimal configuration.

## Decision

We will use **Netlify** as our primary platform for hosting the frontend, deploying the serverless backend functions, and managing the CI/CD pipeline.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Integrated Git Workflow:** Netlify's core value proposition is its direct integration with GitHub. Pushing code to the main branch automatically triggers a build and deploy, which is ideal for rapid, iterative development.
    *   **Unified Full-Stack Hosting:** The platform is purpose-built to host static site assets and manage serverless functions in a single, cohesive environment. The proxying of `/api` requests to the serverless function is handled automatically, simplifying configuration.
    *   **Zero-Ops & Scalability:** Netlify is a fully managed platform, eliminating the need for us to provision, manage, or scale servers. It handles the CDN for the frontend and the execution environment for the backend functions.
    *   **Generous Free Tier:** The free tier is sufficient for development, prototyping, and small-scale production use, making it highly cost-effective.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Serverless Function Limitations:** Netlify Functions have constraints on execution time (e.g., 10 seconds on the free tier). This is a critical consideration for our AI API calls, which could time out if the external LLM is slow. This risk must be monitored.
    *   **Platform Lock-in:** The `netlify.toml` configuration and function deployment format are specific to Netlify. While the underlying Express app is portable, migrating the full CI/CD pipeline to another provider (like Vercel or AWS) would require a dedicated effort.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Vercel:** The most direct competitor to Netlify, offering a very similar feature set. The choice of Netlify was likely based on developer preference or prior experience.
    *   **AWS Amplify:** A powerful alternative from AWS that also provides an integrated full-stack workflow. It is often perceived as more complex to configure than Netlify.
    *   **Self-Managed on AWS (S3/CloudFront + Lambda):** This approach offers maximum power and flexibility but was rejected due to its immense configuration and operational complexity, which would have been contrary to the project's goal of rapid development.

# ADR-006: Choice of UI Component Library

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

To achieve a professional, consistent, and feature-rich user interface within a rapid development timeline, a pre-built component library is necessary. The application requires complex components for both the customer-facing portal and the data-intensive admin dashboard, including modals, data grids, and forms.

## Decision

We will use **Material UI (MUI)** as the primary UI component library for the React frontend. This includes the core `@mui/material` library and the `@mui/x-data-grid` for the admin dashboard.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Comprehensive Component Set:** MUI provides a vast array of well-documented, accessible components out-of-the-box, significantly accelerating the development of complex UIs like `RequestDetailModal.tsx` and `Dashboard.tsx`.
    *   **Professional Aesthetic:** The Material Design system offers a clean, professional, and widely recognized look-and-feel, which builds trust for a business-focused application.
    *   **Data-Grid Functionality:** The `@mui/x-data-grid` component is extremely powerful, providing sorting, filtering, and pagination with minimal setup, which is a massive time-saver for the admin command center.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Bundle Size:** Full-featured component libraries like MUI can be heavy and may increase the initial page load time if not carefully managed with code-splitting.
    *   **Styling System:** MUI uses its own styling solution (`@emotion/styled`). This can introduce a learning curve and make it more complex to override styles compared to a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Opinionated Design:** The components are strongly styled, which can make achieving a highly unique, custom brand aesthetic more work.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides maximum flexibility. It was not chosen as the primary library because it would have required building complex components like modals and data grids from scratch, slowing down the initial prototyping.
    *   **Shadcn/ui:** A popular library that provides unstyled, composable components. It's an excellent middle ground but requires more setup and composition for each component, making it slightly slower for a rapid POC compared to MUI's ready-to-use components.

# ADR-007: Choice of Data Validation Library

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

To ensure the integrity and security of our backend API, all incoming data from clients must be rigorously validated. This prevents malformed data from reaching our controllers and database, and serves as a hard contract for our API endpoints.

## Decision

We will use **Zod** as the data validation library for our Node.js/Express backend. All schemas will be defined in `vite-app/api/validation/schemas.js` and applied via a reusable middleware.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **TypeScript-First:** Zod is designed with TypeScript in mind. Its ability to infer static TypeScript types directly from validation schemas (`z.infer`) is a powerful feature for maintaining sync between runtime validation and compile-time type safety.
    *   **Simple, Chainable API:** Zod's API is fluent and easy to read, making complex schemas straightforward to define (e.g., `.string().uuid("Invalid ID format.")`).
    *   **Server/Client Portability:** Zod schemas can be used on both the server (for validation) and the client (for form validation), allowing for a single source of truth for data contracts.
    *   **Detailed Error Messages:** When validation fails, Zod provides rich, detailed error objects that can be sent directly to the client for clear feedback, as seen in `validationMiddleware.js`.

*   **Cons:**
    *   None of significant note for this project's scale. It is a modern and highly regarded library.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **Joi:** An older, very popular validation library, particularly in the JavaScript ecosystem. Zod was chosen for its superior TypeScript integration.
    *   **Yup:** Often used for client-side form validation (especially with Formik). Zod was chosen for its versatility and strong server-side use case.
    *   **Manual Validation:** Writing custom validation logic in each controller was rejected as it is highly repetitive, error-prone, and difficult to maintain.

# ADR-008: Choice of Transactional Email Service

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**Status:** Decided & Implemented

## Context

The application needs to send transactional emails to users for critical events, such as confirming a quote request submission, notifying of a status update, and sending new quotes. A reliable third-party service is required to ensure high deliverability.

## Decision

We will use **Resend** as our transactional email service provider, integrated via its official `resend` npm package in `vite-app/api/services/emailService.js`.

## Consequences

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Developer-Focused API:** Resend offers a clean, modern, and simple API, which makes sending emails from our Node.js backend straightforward.
    *   **React Email Integration:** While not currently used, Resend's strong integration with the React Email library provides a powerful future path for creating beautiful, component-based email templates.
    *   **Simple Setup:** The setup is minimal, requiring only an API key and a verified domain, which aligns with our goal of rapid development.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Third-Party Dependency:** This adds another external service to our stack, with its own potential points of failure and cost model.
    *   **Deliverability Management:** As with any email service, we are responsible for maintaining a good sender reputation to avoid being marked as spam.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   **SendGrid / Mailgun:** These are larger, more established players in the space. Resend was chosen for its modern API and strong focus on the developer experience.
    *   **AWS Simple Email Service (SES):** A very powerful and cost-effective solution. It was rejected for this project due to its significantly more complex setup and configuration process, which would have slowed down development.

# AI Agent-Driven Development Workflow

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the AI agent-driven development workflow for the PlumbingPOC project. The workflow leverages a multi-agent system to automate UI/UX analysis, code implementation, and task management in a state-aware loop.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
*   **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended).
*   **npm** (comes with Node.js).
*   A running instance of the **PlumbingPOC web application**.

## 2. One-Time Setup

These steps only need to be performed once to prepare your environment.

### Step 1: Install Node.js Dependencies

Install all necessary Node.js packages by running the following command from the **project root directory** (`PlumbingPOC/`):

```bash
npm install playwright @google/generative-ai --legacy-peer-deps dotenv
```

This command installs:
*   `playwright`: For browser automation.
*   `@google/generative-ai`: For integrating with the Gemini API.
*   `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from the `.env` file.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

The agents require API keys and URLs to function.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the **project root directory**.
2.  Copy and paste the following content into the `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys and URLs.

    ```
    # Your Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio
    GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>

    # The full URL where your local Vite/React app is running
    VITE_FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173

    # The WebSocket endpoint for the Playwright server (default)
    PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:49982/
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Playwright Server

For the agents to control a browser, the Playwright server must be running. Open a **separate, dedicated terminal** and run the following command. Leave this terminal running in the background.

```bash
npx playwright run-server
```
*Note: This uses the official, built-in Playwright server, which is simpler and more reliable than third-party alternatives.*

### Step 4:  run the chrome as a host for testing
```bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-mcp
```

---

## 3. The End-to-End AI Workflow

This is the main, orchestrated workflow that uses the Project Manager agent to automate the entire UI improvement lifecycle.

### How It Works: The State-Aware Feedback Loop

This workflow is designed to prevent duplicate work and create a clear audit trail.

1.  **Task Generation:** The `project-manager-mcp-agent` first calls the `ui-designer-mcp-agent`. The designer analyzes the UI and creates a `ui-feedback.json` file with a `status` of `"pending"`.
2.  **Task Assignment:** The Project Manager reads the pending feedback and formally assigns the implementation task.
3.  **Implementation & State Update:** The `frontend-developer-mcp-agent` is called. It checks the file's status. Since it's `"pending"`, it implements the code change and then updates the `ui-feedback.json` file's `status` to `"implemented"`.
4.  **Verification & Archiving:** The Project Manager agent takes over again, verifies the status is now `"implemented"`, and archives the completed feedback file to a `feedback/archive/` directory with a timestamp. This "closes the ticket" and prepares the system for the next run.

### Running the Workflow

To run the entire automated workflow, execute the following command from the **project root directory**. Replace `<email>` and `<password>` with valid login credentials for your application.

```bash
node agents/project-manager-mcp-agent.js run-workflow <email> <password>
```

---

## 4. Standalone Agent Commands (for Testing & Debugging)

You can also run the agents individually. **Note:** Always run these commands from the `PlumbingPOC/` root directory.

### UI Designer Agent

Generates a new `ui-feedback.json` file.

```bash
node agents/ui-designer-mcp-agent.js analyze-ui <email> <password>
```

### Frontend Developer Agent

Implements the feedback from an existing `ui-feedback.json` file.

```bash
node agents/frontend-developer-mcp-agent.js implement-feedback --feedback-file agents/feedback/ui-feedback.json
```

### Backend Architect Agent

Performs a high-level review of your actual backend code.

```bash
node agents/backend-architect-mcp-agent.js review-backend
```

---

## 5. How It Works: Technical Diagrams

### High-Level Workflow Orchestration

      YOUR CURRENT TASK
      ---------------------------
      As the Backend Architect, you are to review the provided database schema and API routes. Your goal is to identify one specific, high-impact improvement related to scalability, security, or best practices and propose a single-line code change to implement it.

      **Database Schema (SUPABASE_TABLES.sql):**
      \`\`\`sql
      ${dbSchemaContent}
      \`\`\`

      \`\`\`javascript
      ${apiRoutesContent}
      \`\`\`

      **Instructions:**
      Your response MUST be a single JSON object with the following structure. The 'file_path' you choose MUST exist in the list of valid files provided above.
      {
        "status": "pending",

From a design principles perspective, this element introduces several problems:\n1.  **Visual Hierarchy Disruption:** The button utilizes a high-contrast, red 'destructive' variant, which immediately draws the user's eye. This color and prominence should be reserved for critical, contextual actions (like deleting a request). Here, it's used for a global, non-contextual action, creating a distracting focal point that pulls attention away from the primary content—the quote requests themselves.\n2.  **Contextual Irrelevance:** A user viewing their quote requests is in a management or review mindset. Placing an urgent, top-level 'Emergency' CTA here is illogical and confusing. Global CTAs for this purpose are already correctly placed in the header and footer, following standard design patterns.\n3.  **Scalability Issues:** The current layout implies that an 'Emergency Line' button will be rendered for each quote request in the list. This is highly redundant and would severely clutter the interface if a user has multiple requests.\nRemoving this button is a high-impact, quick-win improvement. It will declutter the interface, strengthen the visual hierarchy, and allow the user to focus on the primary task of reviewing their quotes, leading to a more streamlined and intuitive experience.",

# AI Agent Contracts

These contracts define the interaction between our backend and the external OpenAI LLM.

### AI Triage Agent

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/triage/:requestId`
*   **Controller:** `vite-app/api/controllers/triageController.js`
*   **Description:** Analyzes a request and returns a structured summary for the admin dashboard.

**Example LLM Output (`application/json`):**
```json
{
  "triage_summary": "An urgent leak under the kitchen sink requires immediate attention.",
  "priority_score": 9,
  "priority_explanation": "Active leaks are high priority to prevent water damage.",
  "profitability_score": 7,
  "profitability_explanation": "Standard repair with high likelihood of conversion."
}
```

### AI Follow-Up Question Agent

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/requests/gpt-follow-up`
*   **Controller:** `vite-app/api/controllers/requestController.js`
*   **Description:** Reviews the conversation so far and generates clarifying questions if needed.

**Example LLM Output (Text, to be parsed):**
```text
1. Is the water actively running from the leak?
2. Is the leak located on a hot or cold water line?
```
*Note: As per the refactoring plan, this text-based output is considered fragile and should be updated to a more robust JSON format.*

# PlumbingPOC: Data Contracts

This document provides a human-readable overview of the critical data structures and contracts that govern the flow of information through the PlumbingPOC system. It is the single source of truth for understanding our data model.

## 1. Core Data Models

These are the primary entities persisted in our Supabase database. The source code for these types can be found in `vite-app/src/features/requests/types/index.ts`.

### QuoteRequest

The central entity in the application. Represents a single job from initial customer contact to completion.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` (uuid) | The unique identifier for the request. |
| `created_at` | `string` (timestamp) | When the request was first submitted. |
| `user_id` | `string` (uuid) | Foreign key linking to the `auth.users` table. |
| `status` | `string` | The current stage of the job (`new`, `quoted`, `scheduled`, etc.). |
| `problem_category`| `string` | The main service requested (e.g., "leak_repair"). |
| `answers` | `JSON` | A structured array of all questions asked and answers given during the intake flow. |
| `user_profiles` | `object` | The joined profile data of the customer (name, email, phone). |
| `quote_attachments`| `Array<QuoteAttachment>` | A list of all files attached to this request. |
| `quotes` | `Array<Quote>` | A list of all formal quotes provided for this request. |
| `request_notes` | `Array<RequestNote>` | The communication log between the admin and customer. |
| `triage_summary` | `string` (nullable) | The AI-generated summary of the request for the admin. |
| `priority_score` | `number` (nullable) | The AI-generated priority score (1-10). |
| `profitability_score` | `number` (nullable) | The AI-generated profitability score (1-10). |

## 2. API Endpoint Contracts

These contracts define the shape of data for requests and responses to our Node.js/Express API. The source code for these contracts is in `vite-app/api/validation/schemas.js`.

### POST `/api/requests/submit`

This endpoint is used by the client to submit a new, fully-formed quote request.

**Example Request Body (`application/json`):**
```json
{
  "clarifyingAnswers": [
    { "question": "What is the property type?", "answer": "Residential" },
    { "question": "Are you the homeowner?", "answer": "Yes" }
  ],
  "contactInfo": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "555-123-4567"
  },
  "category": "leak_repair",
  "isEmergency": true
}

## Supabase & Authentication Provider Setup Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the project's Supabase database schema, security policies, and authentication provider setup.

### 1. Supabase Database Configuration

#### 1a. Table Schema Overview

The database is composed of several related tables to manage users, requests, quotes, and communications.

-   **user_profiles**
    -   Stores public-facing user data, linked one-to-one with `auth.users`.
    -   `id` (uuid, primary key, default: gen_random_uuid())
    -   `user_id` (uuid, **unique**, references `auth.users.id`)
    -   `name` (text)
    -   `email` (text)
    -   `phone` (text)
    -   `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
    -   `address` (text)
    -   `city` (text)
    -   `postal_code` (text)
    -   `province` (text)
    -   `role` (text, not nullable, default: 'user')

-   **requests**
    -   The core table for initial customer quote requests.
    -   `id` (uuid, primary key, default: gen_random_uuid())
    -   `created_at` (timestamptz, default: now())
    -   `is_emergency` (boolean)
    -   `customer_name` (text)
    -   `service_address` (text)
    -   `contact_info` (text)
    -   `problem_category` (text)
    -   `problem_description` (text)
    -   `property_type` (text)
    -   `is_homeowner` (boolean)
    -   `preferred_timing` (text)
    -   `additional_notes` (text)
    -   `answers` (jsonb)
    -   `status` (text)

#### 1b. Admin Role Check Function (`is_admin`)

To reliably check for administrative privileges within Row Level Security policies without causing infinite recursion, we use a `SECURITY DEFINER` function. This is the standard, most robust method.

-   **Function:** `public.is_admin()`
    -   Returns `true` if the currently authenticated user has the role of 'admin' in their `user_profiles` record, and `false` otherwise.
    -   `SECURITY DEFINER` allows it to query `user_profiles` safely from within an RLS policy on that same table, breaking the recursion loop. All RLS policies that require admin checks now call this function.

#### 1c. Storage Bucket: PlumbingPoCBucket

-   **Purpose:** Securely stores all user-uploaded files (images, PDFs) related to quote requests.
-   **Access:** This bucket is **NOT** public. All access is controlled by Storage Policies.
-   **Policies (SQL):**
    ```sql
    -- Allows any logged-in user to UPLOAD a file.
    CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
    ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK ( bucket_id = 'PlumbingPoCBucket' );

    -- Allows an ADMIN to view/download ANY file.
    -- This now uses our robust is_admin() function.
    CREATE POLICY "Allow admin read access"
    ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING ( is_admin() );
    ```

#### 1d. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

RLS is **ENABLED** on all public tables. The security model is straightforward:
-   **Regular users** can perform actions (create, read, update, delete) only on records they own (where `auth.uid() = user_id`).
-   **Admins** (as determined by the `is_admin()` function) have unrestricted access to all records in all tables.

### 2. Master SQL Setup Script

This single, idempotent script can be run in the Supabase SQL Editor to create the `is_admin` helper function and apply all current, correct security policies for every table.

```sql
-- ========= Part 1: Create the definitive is_admin() helper function =========
-- This function is the single source of truth for checking admin status.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin()
RETURNS boolean AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;


-- ========= Part 2: RLS Enablement and Policy Setup for All Tables =========

-- Table: user_profiles
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DO $$ DECLARE r RECORD; BEGIN FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles') LOOP EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.policyname) || ' ON public.user_profiles;'; END LOOP; END $$;
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for users and admins" ON public.user_profiles FOR SELECT USING ((auth.uid() = user_id) OR (is_admin()));
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for own profile" ON public.user_profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Enable update for users and admins" ON public.user_profiles FOR UPDATE USING ((auth.uid() = user_id) OR (is_admin()));
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for admins" ON public.user_profiles FOR DELETE USING (is_admin());

-- Table: requests
ALTER TABLE public.requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DO $$ DECLARE r RECORD; BEGIN FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'requests') LOOP EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.policyname) || ' ON public.requests;'; END LOOP; END $$;
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for users and admins" ON public.requests FOR SELECT USING ((auth.uid() = user_id) OR (is_admin()));
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for own request" ON public.requests FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Enable update for users and admins" ON public.requests FOR UPDATE USING ((auth.uid() = user_id) OR (is_admin()));
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for admins" ON public.requests FOR DELETE USING (is_admin());

-- Table: quotes
ALTER TABLE public.quotes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DO $$ DECLARE r RECORD; BEGIN FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'quotes') LOOP EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.policyname) || ' ON public.quotes;'; END LOOP; END $$;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all actions for admins" ON public.quotes FOR ALL USING (is_admin());
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for own quotes" ON public.quotes FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Table: quote_attachments
ALTER TABLE public.quote_attachments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DO $$ DECLARE r RECORD; BEGIN FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'quote_attachments') LOOP EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.policyname) || ' ON public.quote_attachments;'; END LOOP; END $$;
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for admins and owners" ON public.quote_attachments FOR SELECT USING ((is_admin()) OR (auth.uid() = (SELECT user_id FROM requests WHERE id = request_id)));
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for owners" ON public.quote_attachments FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = (SELECT user_id FROM requests WHERE id = request_id));
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for admins" ON public.quote_attachments FOR DELETE USING (is_admin());

-- Table: request_notes
ALTER TABLE public.request_notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DO $$ DECLARE r RECORD; BEGIN FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'request_notes') LOOP EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.policyname) || ' ON public.request_notes;'; END LOOP; END $$;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all actions for admins" ON public.request_notes FOR ALL USING (is_admin());
CREATE POLICY "Enable all actions for request owners" ON public.request_notes FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = (SELECT user_id FROM requests WHERE id = request_id));

-- Table: invoices
ALTER TABLE public.invoices ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
DO $$ DECLARE r RECORD; BEGIN FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'invoices') LOOP EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS ' || quote_ident(r.policyname) || ' ON public.invoices;'; END LOOP; END $$;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all actions for admins" ON public.invoices FOR ALL USING (is_admin());
CREATE POLICY "Enable read for own invoices" ON public.invoices FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 3. Authentication Provider Configuration

#### 3a. Updating URLs
- Site URL: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/` (production) or `http://your-local-frontend-url/` (local)
- Add Redirect URLs:
  - `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/*`
  - `http://your-local-frontend-url/*`
- Save changes in Supabase dashboard under Authentication → URL Configuration.

#### 3b. Adding Authentication Providers
- Go to Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Providers
- Enable and configure each provider (Google, Azure)

#### 3c. Configuring Applications for OAuth

##### Google OAuth2 Client Setup (Google Cloud Console)
1. Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
2. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
3. Set the name (e.g., PlumbingPoCClient).
4. Add Authorized redirect URI:
   - `https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
5. (Optional) Add Authorized JavaScript origins for local development:
   - `http://your-local-backend-url/`
   - `http://your-local-frontend-url/`
6. Save and copy the Client ID and Client Secret.
7. Enter these values in Supabase dashboard under Authentication → Providers → Google.
8. Ensure the following scopes are enabled in Google:
   - `email`
   - `profile`
   - `openid`
9. Save changes in both Supabase and Google Cloud Console.

URL:  https://console.cloud.google.com/


##### Azure Entra App Registration (Microsoft Entra Admin Center)
1. Register a new app in Microsoft Entra admin center.
2. Set the Redirect URI:
   - Platform: Web
   - URI: `https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Certificates & Secrets:
   - Create a new client secret and copy the value.
4. API Permissions:
    - Microsoft Graph → Delegated permissions:
       - `openid` (required for authentication)
       - `email` (required to get user's email)
       - `User.Read` (required to read user profile info)
    - Click "Grant admin consent" for your directory to ensure all permissions are active.
5. Token Configuration (Optional Claims):
    - Go to "Token configuration" in Azure portal.
    - Add an optional claim for `email` in the ID token:
       - Click "Add optional claim" → ID token → select `email`.
       - Confirm the claim appears in the list as shown in the Azure portal.
       - This ensures the user's email is included in the token sent to Supabase.
    - (Status: claim added as of August 21, 2025)
6. Branding & Properties:
   - Set app name and logo as desired.
7. Enter Azure Client ID and Client Secret in Supabase dashboard under Authentication → Providers → Azure.
8. Save changes in both Supabase and Azure portal.

URL:  https://entra.microsoft.com

### 4. Troubleshooting
- **Infinite Recursion Error:** If you see an "infinite recursion" error, use the `is_admin()` function pattern described in this document. This `SECURITY DEFINER` function is the standard way to break recursion loops in RLS policies.
- **Admin Can't See All Data:** If an admin can't see all records in a table, it means the `SELECT` policy for that table is missing the `OR is_admin()` condition.
- **After Updating Policies:** Policies using the `is_admin()` function do **not** require you to log out and back in. A simple page refresh is sufficient.
- **OAuth Issues:** Ensure permissions are granted/consented, client secrets are valid, and redirect URIs are identical in both the provider's dashboard and Supabase.

# E2E Test Suite: PlumbingPOC

**Engineering-First Approach: Start Small, Build Complex** 🏗️

## 📋 Overview

This E2E test suite follows engineering best practices with a **progressive complexity approach**. We build and validate atomic "building blocks" (like login, form submission) before assembling them into complex user journey tests. This `README.md` serves as our living project plan and status tracker.

## 🏗️ Key Principles Applied

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulates UI interactions in reusable, maintainable classes.
- **Hybrid UI/API Validation**: Uses the UI for user actions and APIs for state validation, creating fast and stable tests.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Centralizes test data, configurations, and helper utilities.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds from simple component checks to complex end-to-end scenarios.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures every test is independent and can be run in isolation.

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap & Status

This roadmap tracks our progress. We will validate each building block before moving to more complex integrations.

<!-- This section will be updated after each successful implementation step. -->

### Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Current Focus)
- [x] **Project Structure**: Directory structure defined and created.
- [x] **README Charter**: This document is created and agreed upon.
- [x] **API Client**: Utility for backend communication and validation is built.
- [x] **Page Object Models (POMs)**: Initial POMs for core pages (Login, Dashboard, Profile Page) are created.
- [x] **Playwright Fixtures**: Base fixtures for pages and API client are set up.

### Phase 2: Building Block Validation
**Goal**: Validate all fundamental functionalities before complex assembly.

**✅ Critical Building Blocks Status:**

- [x] **User Authentication**: Login and Logout flow works via UI.
- [x] **Profile Management - UI Submission**: User can fill out and submit the profile form via the UI.
- [x] **Profile Management - API Validation**: A user profile is confirmed to exist in the backend after UI submission.
- [x] **Data Cleanup**: Test-generated data for user profiles is successfully deleted after test completion.

### Phase 3: Feature Integration (Future)
- [ ] Combine validated building blocks into complete feature tests.

### Phase 4: User Journey Assembly (Future)
- [ ] Create end-to-end user experience tests from multiple features.

# End-to-End (E2E) Test Strategy

**Purpose**: Simulate complete user journeys to validate the application works end-to-end from the user's perspective.

## 🎯 Layer Purpose

This layer focuses on **user experience validation** - ensuring that all components work together seamlessly to deliver a complete, functional user experience. We simulate real user interactions and validate both UI behavior and backend state changes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Playwright**: Modern, reliable browser automation
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Encapsulated UI interactions
- **Hybrid Validation**: UI actions + API state validation
- **Custom Fixtures**: Reusable test setup and teardown

## 📋 Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Page Object Model (POM)
```typescript
// Encapsulated UI interactions
export class QuoteRequestPage {
  async openQuoteRequestModal() {
    await this.page.click('[data-testid="quote-button"]');
  }

  async createQuoteRequest(data: QuoteData) {
    // Complete form filling workflow
  }
}
```

### 2. Hybrid UI/API Validation
```typescript
// UI action + API validation
await quotePage.createQuoteRequest(testData);
const apiValidation = await apiClient.validateRequestData(testData);
expect(apiValidation).toBe(true);
```

### 3. Atomic Test Design
```typescript
test('should create quote request', async ({ page }) => {
  // PRECONDITIONS: User authentication must work

## 🚀 Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/quote-requests/quote-creation.spec.ts

# Run with browser selection
npm run test:e2e:chromium

# Run with debugging
npm run test:e2e -- --debug

# Run with video recording
npm run test:e2e -- --video
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Test Execution**: < 30 seconds for critical user journeys
- **Reliability**: > 95% pass rate in CI/CD
- **Coverage**: All critical user paths tested
- **Maintainability**: < 5 minutes to update for UI changes

## 🔧 Best Practices

### 1. Page Object Model
- **Single Responsibility**: Each POM class handles one page/feature
- **Method Naming**: Descriptive method names (e.g., `createQuoteRequest()`)
- **Selector Strategy**: Use data-testid attributes for reliable selection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing elements

### 2. Test Data Management
- **Isolation**: Each test uses unique data
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup via fixtures
- **Realism**: Test data mirrors production scenarios
- **Reusability**: Shared test data across related tests

### 3. Hybrid Validation Strategy
- **UI Validation**: Visual and interaction verification
- **API Validation**: Backend state verification
- **Data Integrity**: End-to-end data flow validation
- **Performance**: Fast feedback with API shortcuts

### 4. Test Independence
- **No Dependencies**: Tests can run in any order
- **Self-Contained**: Each test includes all prerequisites
- **Cleanup**: Proper teardown and data cleanup
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests designed for concurrent running

## 🔗 Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Frontend application running on `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Database connection available
- Test user accounts configured

**Test Order:**
1. `auth/` - Authentication foundation
2. `quote-requests/` - Core functionality
3. `dashboard/` - User experience
4. `profile/` - User management

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison testing
- **Performance Testing**: Page load and interaction timing
- **Cross-browser Matrix**: Full browser compatibility
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance validation

# Integration & API Test Strategy

**Purpose**: Validate the API contract and ensure backend services work correctly with proper authentication and error handling.

## 🎯 Layer Purpose

This layer focuses on **API contract validation** - ensuring that our backend services behave exactly as expected by the frontend and other consumers. We test the complete request/response cycle, authentication, and error scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Vitest**: Fast, modern test runner with excellent TypeScript support
- **Native Fetch**: Direct HTTP calls to test real API behavior
- **Custom Test Utilities**: Authentication helpers and data validation

## 📋 Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Authentication Testing
```typescript
// Test authenticated endpoints
const response = await fetch('/api/requests/submit', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

### 2. CRUD Operation Validation
```typescript
// Test full lifecycle: Create → Read → Update → Delete
const created = await api.createQuoteRequest(testData);
const retrieved = await api.getQuoteRequest(created.id);
expect(retrieved.problem_category).toBe(testData.category);
```

### 3. Error Scenario Coverage
```typescript
// Test authentication failures
const response = await fetch('/api/requests/submit');
expect(response.status).toBe(401);
```

## 📁 Test Organization

```
tests/integration/api/
├── README.md              # This strategy document
├── health.test.ts         # Server connectivity validation
└── requests.test.ts       # Quote request API testing
```

## ✅ Current Test Coverage

### Health & Connectivity
- [x] Server startup and basic connectivity
- [x] Health endpoint response validation
- [x] CORS configuration testing

### Quote Request API
- [x] **Authentication Required**: 401 for unauthenticated requests
- [x] **Request Structure Validation**: Proper payload format
- [x] **Response Validation**: Correct response structure
- [x] **Error Handling**: 400/403/500 scenarios
- [x] **Data Integrity**: Request data properly stored

## 🚀 Running API Tests

```bash
# Run all API integration tests
npm run test:run -- tests/integration/api/

# Run specific test file
npm run test:run -- tests/integration/api/requests.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:run -- --coverage tests/integration/api/
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Test Execution**: < 5 seconds for full suite
- **Coverage**: > 90% of API endpoints tested
- **Reliability**: 100% pass rate in CI/CD
- **Maintainability**: Tests update automatically with API changes

## 🔧 Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Management
- Use isolated test data that doesn't affect production
- Clean up test data after each test run
- Avoid dependencies on existing production data

### 2. Authentication Handling
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
- Use Supabase authentication for JWT tokens
- Handle authentication failures gracefully
- Load test credentials from environment variables

### 3. Error Testing
- Test all documented error scenarios
- Validate error response formats
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Keep tests fast (< 100ms per test)
- Use parallel execution when possible
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## 🔗 Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Backend API server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Database connection available
- Test user accounts configured

**Test Order:**
1. `health.test.ts` - Basic connectivity
2. `requests.test.ts` - Core functionality

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Load Testing**: Performance under concurrent requests
- **Database State Validation**: Direct database checks
- **External API Mocking**: Third-party service simulation
- **Contract Testing**: API specification validation

# Unit Test Strategy

**Purpose**: Validate individual functions and components in isolation to ensure they work correctly and maintain high code quality.

## 🎯 Layer Purpose

This layer focuses on **isolated function validation** - testing pure functions, utility methods, and individual components without external dependencies. We ensure each building block works correctly before integration.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Vitest**: Fast, modern test runner with excellent TypeScript support
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **jsdom**: Browser environment simulation for React components
- **Custom Mocks**: Isolated testing without external dependencies

## 📋 Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Pure Function Testing
```typescript
// Test utility functions in isolation
describe('getRequestStatusChipColor', () => {
  it('should return correct color for "new" status', () => {
    expect(getRequestStatusChipColor('new')).toBe('primary');
  });
});
```

### 2. Component Testing
```typescript
// Test React components with RTL
describe('QuoteRequestModal', () => {
  it('should render with correct title', () => {
    render(<QuoteRequestModal isOpen={true} />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Request a Quote')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 3. Mock Dependencies
```typescript
// Isolate external dependencies
const mockSupabase = vi.fn();
vi.mock('../../../lib/supabaseClient', () => ({
  supabase: mockSupabase
}));
```

## 📁 Test Organization

```
tests/unit/
├── README.md              # This strategy document
└── utils/                 # Utility function tests
    ├── serviceQuoteQuestions.test.ts
    └── statusColors.test.ts
```

## ✅ Current Test Coverage

### Utility Functions
- [x] **Service Quote Categories**: Category validation and structure
- [x] **Status Colors**: Color mapping for request statuses
- [x] **Data Validation**: Input/output format verification
- [x] **Edge Cases**: Error handling and boundary conditions

### Future Component Tests
- [ ] **React Components**: Individual component testing
- [ ] **Custom Hooks**: Hook logic validation
- [ ] **Form Validation**: Input validation logic
- [ ] **UI Utilities**: Styling and display functions

## 🚀 Running Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test:run -- tests/unit/

# Run specific test file
npm run test:run -- tests/unit/utils/serviceQuoteQuestions.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:run -- --coverage tests/unit/

# Watch mode for development
npm run test -- --watch tests/unit/
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Test Execution**: < 2 seconds for full suite
- **Coverage**: > 80% for utility functions
- **Isolation**: Zero external dependencies in tests
- **Maintainability**: Tests update automatically with code changes

## 🔧 Best Practices

### 1. Test Isolation
- **No External Dependencies**: Mock all external services
- **Pure Functions**: Test functions with predictable inputs/outputs
- **Single Responsibility**: One test per behavior
- **Descriptive Names**: Clear test and describe block names

### 2. Test Data Management
- **Realistic Data**: Use production-like test data
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error states
- **Data Variety**: Multiple scenarios per function
- **Consistency**: Standardized test data patterns

### 3. Mock Strategy
- **Minimal Mocking**: Only mock what's necessary
- **Realistic Mocks**: Mocks behave like real dependencies
- **Clear Setup**: Obvious mock configuration
- **Cleanup**: Proper mock reset between tests

### 4. Performance Considerations
- **Fast Execution**: Keep tests under 100ms each
- **Parallel Running**: Tests designed for concurrent execution
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal memory and CPU usage
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Reliable in automated environments

## 🔗 Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js environment with test dependencies installed
- TypeScript compilation working
- Source code accessible for testing

**Test Setup:**
- Vitest configuration in `vitest.config.ts`
- Test environment setup in `tests/setup.ts`
- Path aliases configured for imports

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Component Testing**: React component unit tests
- **Hook Testing**: Custom React hook validation
- **Integration Unit Tests**: Multi-function workflows
- **Performance Testing**: Function execution timing
- **Snapshot Testing**: UI component snapshots
- **Visual Regression**: Component appearance validation

# PlumbingPOC API Server

This document outlines the architecture and conventions for the PlumbingPOC API server, built with Node.js and Express using an MVC-inspired pattern.

## Core Architecture: MVC Pattern

**Model:** Supabase handles all database interactions, data shaping, and enforces data integrity through its schema and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**View:** For a REST API, the "View" is the JSON data sent to the client. Controllers assemble and send these responses.

**Controller:** Contains the core business logic. Controllers receive requests from routes, interact with the Model (Supabase), and send a response back through the View (JSON).

---

## Directory Structure

```text
api/
├── controllers/           # Business logic (MVC: Controller)
│   └── requestController.js
├── middleware/            # Reusable functions before controllers
│   ├── authMiddleware.js
│   └── validationMiddleware.js
├── routes/                # Maps URLs to controllers
│   └── requestRoutes.js
├── validation/            # Data contracts (schemas)
│   └── schemas.js
└── server.js              # Main application entry point
```

## File Responsibilities

### `server.js`

- Initializes the Express app
- Configures core middleware (CORS, body-parser)
- Loads and delegates all API routes to the `routes/` directory
- Defines a global error handler
- Starts the server

### `/routes`

Defines endpoints (e.g., `/submit`, `/:requestId/notes`), specifies HTTP methods (GET, POST), and chains middleware before passing the request to the controller.

**Example from `requestRoutes.js`:**

```javascript
// Create a formal quote for a request (admin only)
router.post(
    '/:requestId/quotes', // The Path
    authenticate,         // Middleware 1: Is the user logged in?
    isAdmin,              // Middleware 2: Does the user have admin role?
    validate(createQuoteSchema), // Middleware 3: Is the request body valid?
    createQuoteForRequest // The Controller function to run
);
```

### `/controllers`

Self-contained business logic for specific tasks (e.g., submitting a quote, adding a note). Receives `req` and `res` after middleware.

### `/middleware`

Reusable functions between route and controller.
- `authMiddleware.js`: Handles authentication (`authenticate`) and role-based authorization (`isAdmin`).
- `validationMiddleware.js`: Generic `validate` function checks incoming request data against a schema.

### `/validation`

Defines "data contracts" using zod. Each schema in `schemas.js` clearly defines the expected shape and types for endpoint request bodies, params, or queries.

## Request Lifecycle

1. **Client Request:** React app sends a POST request to `/api/requests/:id/notes`.
2. **server.js:** Request hits `server.js`, passes through CORS and JSON body parser.
3. **routes/requestRoutes.js:** Router matches path/method, applies `authenticate` middleware and `addNote` controller.
4. **middleware/authMiddleware.js:** `authenticate` checks for valid JWT, attaches `req.user` and calls `next()`. If invalid, sends 401 Unauthorized and stops flow.
5. **controllers/requestController.js:** `addRequestNote` runs, interacts with Supabase, sends JSON response (e.g., `res.status(201).json(...)`).
6. **Client Receives Response:** React app receives JSON data or error message.

This clean separation makes the system robust and predictable.

## API Testing and Troubleshooting with cURL and JWT

When developing or debugging API endpoints that require authentication, `cURL` is an invaluable tool. Here's how to use it effectively with JWT tokens:

### 1. Getting Your JWT Token from the Browser

To interact with authenticated endpoints, you'll need a valid JWT token. You can obtain this from your browser's developer tools after a successful login:

1. Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12 or Cmd+Option+I).
2. Go to the 'Network' tab.
3. Perform an action in your application that triggers an authenticated API request (e.g., logging in, fetching user data).
4. Find the relevant API request in the Network tab.
5. In the request details, look for the 'Headers' section.
6. Locate the `Authorization` header. The value will typically be in the format `Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>`. Copy the `<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>` part.

### 2. Constructing and Executing the cURL Command

Once you have your token, you can construct a `cURL` command to test authenticated endpoints. Remember to replace placeholders with your actual data.

```bash
curl -X <HTTP_METHOD> \
     http://localhost:3000/api/<YOUR_ENDPOINT> \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>" \
     -d '{"key": "value"}' # Only for POST/PUT requests with a body
```

**Important:** When executing in your terminal, ensure the entire `cURL` command is on a **single line** to avoid shell parsing errors.

### 3. Troubleshooting JWT Tokens with jwt.io

If you encounter "Unauthorized: Invalid token" errors, your JWT might be expired or malformed. `jwt.io` is an excellent online tool for inspecting JWTs:

1. Go to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).
2. Paste your full JWT token into the 'Encoded' section on the left.
3. **Expected Result:** You will likely see a message like "a-string-secret-at-least-256-bits-long" in the "Signature Verified" section. This is normal and expected, as `jwt.io` does not have access to your Supabase project's secret key to verify the token's signature. The important part is to inspect the payload.
4. The 'Payload' section on the right will decode the token, showing its claims (data).
5. **Check the `exp` (expiration) claim:** This is a Unix timestamp. If the current time is past this timestamp, your token has expired, and you'll need to generate a new one.
6. **Inspect other claims:** Ensure that claims like `role` (e.g., `admin`) and `email` match your expectations for the user.
