# Client Billing & Account Management Strategies

**Document Purpose:** Compare different approaches to managing client infrastructure accounts and billing for web development/SaaS consulting services.

---

## üè¢ How Web Companies Typically Handle This

### **Model 1: Agency/Reseller Model (Most Common)**
**What most web agencies do:**
- Agency owns all hosting/service accounts
- Client pays monthly fee to agency
- Agency manages all technical aspects
- Agency can instantly turn off services for non-payment

**Examples:**
- **WP Engine Reseller:** Agency has master account, creates sub-sites
- **Shopify Partners:** Partner handles billing, client gets service
- **AWS Reseller Programs:** Agency consolidates billing

### **Model 2: Client Direct Model**
**What consultants/freelancers often do:**
- Client owns accounts directly
- Consultant gets delegated access
- Client pays services directly
- Consultant bills separately for management

### **Model 3: Hybrid Model**
**What larger tech companies do:**
- Core infrastructure: Agency owned
- Domain/email: Client owned
- Clear data portability guarantees

## üìä COMPARISON: Agency-Owned vs Client-Owned Accounts

| Factor | Agency-Owned Accounts | Client-Owned Accounts |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Control** | Full control over services | Client controls, you manage |
| **Revenue** | Markup + recurring revenue | Service fee only |
| **Payment Leverage** | Can shut off for non-payment | No payment leverage |
| **Client Trust** | Lower (vendor lock-in concern) | Higher (transparent costs) |
| **Legal Liability** | Higher (responsible for uptime) | Lower (client's infrastructure) |
| **Scalability** | Easier to manage at scale | More complex per-client setup |
| **Exit Strategy** | Complex migration process | Simple access revocation |
| **Cash Flow** | You float costs until payment | No cash flow risk |
| **Markup Transparency** | Can hide true costs | Fully transparent costs |

Status: ‚ùå API key sharing required - no team features available
```

### **Practical Setup Workflow:**

#### **During Guided Setup Call (Screen Share):**
```
Hour 1: Account Creation & Access Setup

Modern Platform Accounts (Delegated Access):
1. Client creates Netlify account ‚Üí Invites your email as Team Member
2. Client creates Supabase account ‚Üí Invites your email as Administrator
3. Client creates Google Cloud project ‚Üí Adds your email as Editor

API Service Accounts (Credential Sharing):
4. Client creates OpenAI account ‚Üí Generates API key ‚Üí Shares securely
5. Client creates Resend account ‚Üí Generates API key ‚Üí Shares securely
6. Client creates Twilio account ‚Üí Shares Account SID + Auth Token securely

All access delegation completed during this session
```

#### **Post-Setup Technical Work:**
```
You work independently using:
- Delegated platform access (Netlify, Supabase, Google Cloud)
- Shared API credentials (OpenAI, Resend, Twilio)
- Configure databases, deployments, and integrations
- Monitor performance and troubleshoot issues
- All actions logged under your account for audit trail
```

### **üîí Security Best Practices for API Key Sharing:**

#### **Secure Sharing Methods:**
```
‚úÖ Password managers with shared vaults (1Password, Bitwarden)
‚úÖ Encrypted messaging platforms (Signal, ProtonMail)
‚úÖ Secure document sharing with encryption
‚ùå Never email or text API keys in plain text
‚ùå Never store in unencrypted documents or screenshots
```

#### **API Key Management Protocol:**
```
Setup Phase:
- Client generates keys during guided setup call
- Client stores master copies in their password manager
- You receive copies through secure sharing method
- Keys documented in project management system

Ongoing Management:
- Keys rotated every 6-12 months for security
- Immediate revocation capability if needed
- Client maintains master access to all accounts
- Regular access audits and confirmation
```

### **What This Means for Client Onboarding:**

- Provide client with DNS record instructions
- Client makes changes through their registrar panel
- You verify configuration remotely

Option B: Temporary Access
- Client provides temporary access for initial setup
- Client changes password immediately after configuration
- Document all changes made during access period

Option C: Modern DNS Providers
- Recommend registrars with team features (Cloudflare, etc.)
- Transfer DNS management to team-friendly platform
- Client retains domain ownership, you manage DNS
```

### **Updated Service Agreement Language:**

```markdown
## Technical Access & Security

### Access Methods by Platform Type

#### Modern SaaS Platforms (Delegated Access)

Total Year 1: $54,000 CAD
```

### **Agency-Owned Model (10 clients):**
```
Monthly Revenue: 10 √ó $400 = $4,000 CAD
Infrastructure Costs: 10 √ó $135 = $1,350 CAD
Net Monthly: $2,650 CAD
Annual Net: $31,800 CAD
Plus setup fees: 10 √ó $2,000 = $20,000 CAD
Total Year 1: $51,800 CAD
```

**Key Insight:** Client-owned model can be more profitable due to higher setup fees and no infrastructure float costs.

---

## üéØ CONCLUSION

**For starting out:** **Client-owned model** is recommended because:
- Lower complexity and risk
- Builds trust faster
- No cash flow management
- Easier to scale initially
- Professional consultant positioning

**For growth phase:** Offer both models and let the market decide. Many clients will prefer the transparency of client-owned accounts, while others will pay premium for fully managed service.

The key is being **transparent about your approach** and **delivering exceptional value** regardless of the billing model chosen.
