# Email Templates for Plumbing Business Outreach

## Template 1: Professional Value-Focused Approach

**Subject:** A better way to manage jobs at [Business Name]?

**Hi [Owner's Name],**

My name is Richard Fremmerlid, and I'm a Victoria-based tech consultant. I build software for local trades businesses that solves the biggest headaches I hear about: wasting time, losing jobs, and disorganized communication.

I've built a complete "Command Center" platform that I believe can give you back hours every week.

Instead of a long explanation, here's a 5-minute video tour showing exactly how it works:

**[Click Here to Watch the 5-Minute Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/1ead7162412140bea1f46988af675adf)**

*Video highlights: AI-powered quote intake, interactive Map View with job locations, one-click AI Triage, and the complete Command Center workflow.*

You can try out the site yourself here:  [https://copilotfortrades.com/](https://copilotfortrades.com/)

Here are the specific problems this system is built to solve:

*   **Problem: Wasting billable hours on unqualified leads?**
    *   **✅ Solved.** An AI assistant asks all the right questions up front, delivering perfectly qualified leads directly to your dashboard. No more 15-minute phone calls just to get basic info.

*   **Problem: Losing jobs because quoting is slow or details are scattered?**
    *   **✅ Solved.** The Command Center organizes every detail—customer info, photos, and even an AI-generated summary—into one place. You can create and send professional quotes in minutes, not hours.

*   **Problem: Wasting hours driving between jobs?**
    *   **✅ Solved.** The interactive Map View plots all your jobs geographically. Instantly see nearby jobs and optimize your daily route.

This platform is ready to go today, but it's also a foundation we can easily build on. Once the core system is in place, we can quickly enable features like **instant SMS alerts** for new leads, **automated quote follow-ups**, and **online credit card payments** via Stripe.

**A Unique Opportunity:**

I'm looking to get a tankless gas hot water heater installed in my garage. I know many plumbing businesses also do gas installs, and I'm interested in establishing a partnership where we can trade services. You get a cutting-edge business platform, and I get access to quality plumbing expertise.

If you have 5 minutes to watch the video, I'm confident you'll see a tool that could become the engine for your business's growth for years to come.

Would you be open to a quick chat about it?

Thanks,

## Template 2: Direct Trade Proposal Approach

**Subject:** Trade proposal - AI plumbing platform for service work?

**Hi [Business Owner's Name],**

I'm looking to do some side work, and was wondering if we could work out some sort of trade.

As a side job, I developed a proof-of-concept site for an AI enabled plumbing business command center. It's much more of a complete client management system for a trades business, rather than a simple website with a contact form.

Imagine your customer can go and request a job quote, but instead of just providing information in an email form, an AI agent guides them through some questions relevant to their type of request, to get the type of information you need to give a quote. After they submit the quote request through website (using their computer or phone), you receive an SMS message indicating a request for quote was received. You open your "command center", you can view all the answers to their questions, see any pictures they've attached, and you can send them a quote, that would send them an SMS message as well.

You can see all your quote requests, approved quotes, scheduled jobs, etc. It's actually quite smart.

I made a 5-minute tour showing exactly how this end-to-end system works:

You can also try the client experience yourself at:
https://copilotfortrades.com

Feel free to register/sign in (using your Microsoft or Gmail account) and go through requesting a quote - you'll see how the AI guides customers through the questions and how they can upload photos of their plumbing issues. I can show you the business owner side separately if you're interested - that's where you'd see all the incoming requests, use the AI triage, send quotes, etc.

Here's the unique part: I'm looking to get a tankless gas hot water heater installed in my garage at some point in the future. I know many plumbing businesses also do gas installs, and I'm interested in establishing a partnership where we can trade services. I'm thinking this could be the start of an ongoing relationship - you get a cutting-edge business platform, and I get access to quality plumbing expertise as needed.

If you have 5 minutes, I think you'll see something that could put you years ahead of your competition.

Thanks,

## Template 3: Bridgeman Plumbing - Personalized Legacy Approach

**TO:** info@bridgemanplumbing.ca

**Subject:** AI Plumbing Platform for Bridgeman Plumbing

**Hi Bridgeman team,**

My name is Richard Fremmerlid. I was searching for a top-rated local company plumbing and gas fitting company. I see you've been operating in Victoria for over 30 years.

This might be a different kind of email than you usually get. By day, I work in IT for the government. As a personal project, I build software that automates many of the most time-consuming parts of running a trades business.

The system I created gives you a central place to manage the entire lifecycle of a job from the initial customer request for a quote all the way to final payment. It leverages the power of AI, more specifically a conversational AI agent to ask questions about their problem or need to qualify leads, this lets you quote jobs in minutes, add quotes to those requests, track all your work, and even shows you a map of all your scheduled work to help optimize your routes.

Instead of a long explanation, here's a 5-minute video showing the complete workflow (both the customer experience and your admin view):

**[Click Here to Watch the 5-Minute Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/1ead7162412140bea1f46988af675adf)**

You can also try the customer experience yourself on the live site:
**[Explore the Live Site](https://copilotfortrades.com)**

Here are the specific problems this system is built to solve:

**Stop Wasting Time on the Phone:** An AI assistant asks all the right questions, gets photos of the issue, and delivers a perfectly qualified lead. No more 15-minute calls just to find out it's a small, unqualified job.

**Get Instant SMS Alerts for New Leads:** The moment a customer submits a request, your phone gets a text. Being the first to respond is the best way to win the job.

**Track Every Job in One Place:** See the entire history—from the first AI conversation to the final quote—all organized and instantly accessible. Never lose a detail again.

**Optimize Your Day with a Map View:** See all your jobs plotted on an interactive map, helping you plan the most efficient routes and cut down on fuel and drive time.

**A Straightforward Proposal:**

My main goal with this project is to build a long-term relationship with a trusted local plumber for future work at my home. In the near future, I'll be looking at projects like replacing my hot water tank.

Thanks for your time,

**Richard Fremmerlid**
