# MCP Agents: Prototype Development (Cancelled)

## Details
- [x] Create project-manager-mcp agent prompts for progress tracking and checklist updates
- [x] Create ui-designer-mcp agent prompts for UI/UX evaluation and recommendations
- [x] Create frontend-developer-mcp agent prompts for implementation and optimization
- [x] Create backend-architect-mcp agent prompts for code review and architecture
- [ ] Test agent coordination and automation workflows (cancelled)
- [ ] Deploy automated agent system (cancelled)

## Cancellation Reason
Cancelled due to token cost concerns. Agent prompts are created and useful for manual use in development sessions, but automated agents won't be implemented to avoid ongoing API expenses. Manual prompt usage in chat provides the same benefits without automation costs.
