# Backend: Automatic Email Follow-ups

## Implementation Strategy
**Technology:** Resend API (already integrated in `packages/backend/api/services/email/resend/client.js`).

**Trigger:** A **Netlify Scheduled Function**. This is a special type of function that Netlify can run automatically on a cron schedule (e.g., "every morning at 9 AM").

**Logic:** The scheduled function will query the Supabase database for all requests with a `status` of 'quoted' where the quote was sent more than [e.g., 3 days] ago and no follow-up has been sent. It will then loop through the results and send a templated follow-up email.

## Operational Notes
The `email_audit` table and Supabase migration were added during the recent email work, and transactional emails are successfully sending via Resend from Netlify. However, the current send path is not inserting audit rows into `email_audit` â€” the table exists but contains no records.

## Next Steps (High Priority)
- Implement insertion of audit records in `packages/backend/api/services/email/resend/client.js` immediately after a successful Resend send call. Persist fields: `request_id`, `recipient`, `resend_message_id` (provider id), `provider_response` (jsonb), `status`, `sent_at`.
- Add unit tests and an integration test for audit insertion (run against local Supabase dev or test DB).
- After audit persistence is confirmed, implement PDF invoice generation and attach/send invoice PDF via Resend.
