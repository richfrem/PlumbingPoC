# Business Intelligence & Reporting

## Implementation Strategy
**Technology:** No new third-party services needed initially.

**Logic:** A new, secure API endpoint (e.g., `/api/reports/export`) would be created in the existing Express API. This endpoint would query the Supabase database, aggregate data for a given date range, and generate a downloadable CSV file.

**Key Metrics to Export:**
* Total number of requests
* Conversion rate (quoted vs. accepted)
* Total revenue from completed jobs
* Average job value
* Breakdown of job types

**Value Proposition:**
* **For the Owner:** Make data-driven decisions to grow the business instead of relying on gut feeling.
