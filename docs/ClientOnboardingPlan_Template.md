## 4. Estimated Ongoing Monthly Costs

A key principle of a professional setup is that you own your own infrastructure. This gives you full control and transparency over costs. I've selected highly efficient, modern services that are very affordable. **I will manage all of these services for you.**

| Service | Purpose | Estimated Monthly Cost (CAD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Netlify** | Website Hosting & Functions | ~$25 CAD (`$19 USD`) | The engine that runs your site and automation. |
| **Supabase**| Database & File Storage | ~$35 CAD (`$25 USD`) | Securely stores all your customer and job data. |
| **OpenAI** | AI-Powered Features | ~$5 - $20 CAD | Pay-as-you-go for the AI Triage & quoting features. |
| **Resend** | Email Notifications | ~$0 (Free Tier) | For sending professional quote and status updates. |
| **Domain Name** | `yourbusiness.com` | ~$2 CAD (`~$20/year`) | Billed annually. |

## 5. (Optional) Future Growth: The Automation Engine

Once the core platform is live, we can enable a suite of powerful automation features as part of an ongoing support relationship. These are not included in the initial setup but are easily added:

*   **Instant SMS Alerts** via Twilio for new leads and accepted quotes.
*   **Automated Email Follow-ups** for quotes that haven't been answered.
*   **Online Invoice Payments** via Stripe integration.

We can discuss these value-added services after your core system is up and running.
