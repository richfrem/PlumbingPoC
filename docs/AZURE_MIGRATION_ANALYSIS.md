# Azure Migration Analysis: PlumbingPOC Platform

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of migrating the PlumbingPOC platform from its current Netlify/Supabase architecture to Azure cloud services. As an Azure cloud expert, I've evaluated the technical feasibility, effort requirements, cost implications, and migration strategy for this conversion.

**Key Finding:** For your low-usage scenario (50-100 quote requests/month, minimal file storage), **Azure would actually be 75-85% CHEAPER** than your current setup, not more expensive as initially estimated.

**Critical Technical Insight:** The primary challenges are not in service-to-service mapping (which is straightforward) but in re-implementing Supabase's "batteries-included" features, particularly real-time functionality, authentication, and Row Level Security (RLS). Supabase provides automatic real-time events from database changes, while Azure SignalR requires manual event publishing after every database write.

**ROI Analysis:** At 40-60 hours × $125/hour = $5,000-7,500 development cost, payback period is 4-6 months through $80-120/month savings. However, if purely cost-driven, consider hybrid approach: migrate only database to Azure PostgreSQL (~10-15 hours) for significant savings while retaining Supabase's integrated features.

## Current Architecture Overview

| Component | Current Service | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Frontend Hosting** | Netlify | Static React/Vite application hosting |
| **Serverless Functions** | Netlify Functions | Node.js API endpoints, SMS notifications |
| **Database** | Supabase PostgreSQL | Primary data storage with RLS policies |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth | User authentication (Email, Google, Azure) |
| **File Storage** | Supabase Storage | Image/document uploads for quote requests |
| **Real-time Features** | Supabase Realtime | Live updates for request status changes |
| **Email Service** | Resend | Transactional emails for quotes |
| **SMS Service** | Twilio | Real-time admin notifications |
| **Maps Integration** | Google Maps API | Interactive job location mapping |
| **AI Service** | OpenAI API | Quote triage and follow-up questions |

**Current Monthly Cost Range: $115-155 CAD**

## Detailed Service Migration Guide

### 1. Frontend Hosting Migration

**Current: Netlify**
- Static site hosting with CDN
- Git-based deployments
- Custom domain management

**Target: Azure Static Web Apps**
- **Migration Steps:**
  1. Create Azure Static Web Apps resource
  2. Connect GitHub repository
  3. Configure build settings (match current Netlify config)
  4. Migrate custom domain and SSL certificates
  5. Update DNS settings

**Complexity:** Medium (2-3 days)
**Key Changes Required:**

- **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml`)
- **Environment Variables**: Azure Static Web Apps application settings (configured in portal or IaC)
- **Custom Domains**: Azure DNS zones and SSL certificate management

### Infrastructure as Code Options

**For Production Deployments, consider IaC:**

```hcl
# Terraform Example (azure-static-web-app.tf)
resource "azurerm_static_web_app" "plumbingpoc" {
  name                = "plumbingpoc-app"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location

  app_settings = {
    "VITE_SUPABASE_URL" = "https://your-project.supabase.co"
    "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" = "..."
    # ... other environment variables
  }

  build_config {
    build_command = "npm install --include=dev && npx vitest run && npm --workspace=@plumbingpoc/frontend run build"
    output_location = "packages/frontend/dist"
    api_location = "packages/backend/netlify/functions"
  }
}
```

```json
// ARM Template Example (static-web-app.json)
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "resources": [
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/staticSites",
      "apiVersion": "2022-03-01",
      "name": "plumbingpoc-app",
      "location": "East US",
      "properties": {
        "buildProperties": {
          "appBuildCommand": "npm install --include=dev && npx vitest run && npm --workspace=@plumbingpoc/frontend run build",
          "outputLocation": "packages/frontend/dist",
          "appLocation": "/"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Bicep Alternative (Azure's native DSL):**
```bicep
// static-web-app.bicep
resource staticWebApp 'Microsoft.Web/staticSites@2022-03-01' = {
  name: 'plumbingpoc-app'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {
    buildProperties: {
      appBuildCommand: 'npm install --include=dev && npx vitest run && npm --workspace=@plumbingpoc/frontend run build'
      outputLocation: 'packages/frontend/dist'
      appLocation: '/'
    }
  }
}
```

**IaC Recommendation:** For your project size, start with **portal configuration** and **GitHub Actions**. Add IaC (Bicep recommended) when you need repeatable deployments across multiple environments.

**Azure Configuration Examples:**

```json
// staticwebapp.config.json (replaces netlify.toml build settings)
{
  "navigationFallback": {
    "rewrite": "/index.html"
  },
  "mimeTypes": {
    ".json": "application/json",
    ".js": "text/javascript"
  },
  "globalHeaders": {
    "Cache-Control": "no-cache"
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "/api/*",
      "allowedRoles": ["anonymous"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```yaml
// .github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml (replaces Netlify Git integration)
name: Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build And Deploy
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          action: "upload"
          app_location: "/"
          api_location: "packages/backend/netlify/functions"

2. **Long-term Cost Savings**: 5-year savings of $43,000-65,000 justify development investment
3. **Technical Learning**: Building Azure expertise for career/business development
4. **Enterprise Requirements**: Need advanced security, compliance, or Azure integrations

### Consider Hybrid Approach If:

1. **Pure Cost Optimization**: Primary goal is immediate cost reduction
2. **Resource Constraints**: Limited development time/budget
3. **Risk Aversion**: Prefer proven Supabase features over custom Azure implementation

**Hybrid Option: Database-Only Migration (~10-15 hours)**
- Migrate PostgreSQL database to Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Keep Supabase Auth, Realtime, and Storage for integrated features
- Retain Netlify Functions connecting to Azure database
- **Estimated Savings**: $20-27/month (57% of total savings)
- **Risk Level**: Low (standard database migration)
- **Complexity**: Medium (database schema + connection updates)

### De-Risk Strategy: Validate Hardest Parts First

**Phase 1 Priority: Real-Time Proof of Concept**
- Build minimal Azure Function + PostgreSQL + SignalR integration
- Prove manual event publishing works before full migration
- **Success Criteria**: Real-time updates work identically to Supabase

**Phase 2 Priority: Auth + RLS Validation**
- Implement AAD B2C authentication flow
- Rewrite critical RLS policies for Azure PostgreSQL
- **Success Criteria**: Secure multi-tenant data access

### Updated Effort Estimates

**Full Migration: 60-80 hours** (conservative with technical challenges)
**Hybrid Migration: 15-25 hours** (focused on database only)
**POC Validation: 20-30 hours** (prove core concepts before full commitment)

### Decision Framework

**Choose Full Migration If:**
- ROI timeframe acceptable (4-6 months payback)
- Technical challenges viewed as learning opportunities
- Long-term Azure positioning desired

**Choose Hybrid Migration If:**
- Immediate cost savings prioritized
- Supabase's integrated features still valuable
- Minimal development resources available

### Optimization Opportunities

**Immediate (During Migration):**
- Right-size Azure resources based on actual usage
- Implement Azure Hybrid Benefit for existing licenses
- Set up monitoring for cost optimization

**Future (Post-Migration):**
- Azure Reservations for committed workloads
- Azure Spot instances for development environments
- Auto-scaling implementation for variable loads

## Conclusion

The migration from Netlify/Supabase to Azure is **technically feasible** and follows well-established patterns. For your low-usage scenario (50-100 quote requests/month), it represents a **significant time investment** (120-160 hours) but would result in **45-60% DECREASE** in monthly hosting costs ($45-85 vs $115-155).

**Final Recommendation:** **Strongly consider migration for cost savings alone.** The Azure pay-per-use model is perfectly suited for your low-volume usage pattern. With realistic costs of $15-35/month vs your current $115-155/month, you'd achieve **75-85% cost reduction**. The migration effort would pay for itself within 4-6 months through reduced hosting costs.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Validate Azure costs** with Azure Pricing Calculator using your exact usage
2. **Start with database migration** as it offers the biggest cost savings
3. **Consider Azure for Startups** program for additional discounts
4. **Plan migration during slow business period** to minimize operational impact

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct Azure cost modeling with actual usage data
2. Assess internal Azure expertise and training needs
3. Create detailed migration project plan with rollback procedures
4. Consider starting with database migration as a standalone project
